EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is an innovative product that provides interactive documentation to engineers on all functional aspects of a modern ECU. The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR complements other development tools used by engineers by providing access to information that is relevant for understanding a single function or the entire ECU system and for conducting tasks, such as measurement & calibration. The key purpose of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is to support its users to: Find the right information efficiently in a large mass of information. Understand the information efficiently (reading text, exploring interactive models). Get the actual working task done efficiently with the help of the information and the tool (Identifying root cause for calibration errors with the help of dependency analysis in interactive models). EHANDBOOK is the ETAS solution that aims at eliminating drawbacks confronted in static documentation approaches and provides a significant productivity gain in handling large documentations. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR provides an interactive electronic documentation. It consists of a quick, interactive interface to access information, presented in dynamic form (e.g., graphical models with automatic layout). It also provides additional services, such as identification and highlighting of dependencies between models (signal flows). Compared to other documentation solutions, EHANDBOOK provides an effective approach for handling large amounts of documentation content and the required tooling to work with information efficiently. With the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, you are able to quickly and easily find and understand information required to efficiently conduct a large variety of working tasks. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR provides the following key features: Supporting of multiple EHANDBOOK files: EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports to load and combine multiple EHANDBOOK files. In order to work with EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR easily with all content, more than one EHANDBOOK container can be added to an EHANDBOOK project. Flexible documentation structures: EHANDBOOK containers can contain multiple pre-defined documentation views. A Documentation view is a predefined table of contents (TOC) that contains documentation content relevant to different user groups. For example, calibration engineers can select a documentation view with only the relevant content for a specific functionality (e.g, for a calibration package), whereas system architects can select a documentation view on how all functions are structured (software architecture view). Interactive models: An integrated Model Viewer in the EHANDBOOK- NAVIGATOR allows you to explore ASCET block diagram models, Simulink models and C-Code derived models. It is possible for you to navigate within and across hierarchy levels in a model. Auto-layouts create suitable, seamless views of the model, where nested models can be flattened. Label popup: The Meta data details for the labels and other entities of Function Overview Diagrams, Interactive models, SVG images and values for calibration parameters are displayed in the Label pop-up. The Label popup for Curves and Maps additionally displays the respective plots in 2D/3D visualization. Seamless function wallpaper: Seamless function wallpaper supports to navigate from Function Overview to Interactive models in the same window. It helps to make the connections for Function Overviews and Function Specifications (ASCET/Simulink) or Function Implementation (C-Code) seamlessly. Function Documentation: While exploring Interactive models, there might be a need to look at the corresponding documentation. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to view the corresponding documentation in the Document Viewer. This is possible for ASCET block diagram models, Simulink models, C-Code derived model and it works across the hierarchy levels as well. Semantic Search: The Search feature enables you to navigate large documentation content efficiently. You can precisely find semantic information in the documentation content and interactive models. Semantic information comprises of measurement variables, calibration parameters and system constants which are tagged in the content of the EHANDBOOK container. The search results, classified according to their semantic category, are displayed and highlighted in the content. Dependency Analysis Service: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to determine dependencies between blocks of interactive models, e.g. inputs and outputs of functions, calibration parameters and measurement variables. The service works for ASCET block diagram models, Simulink models, C-Code derived models and wherever applicable it works across the hierarchy levels as well (i.e., connections in a sub-hierarchy are followed if it is a block diagram). Both highlighting and hiding of blocks and connections are supported. Highlighted blocks and components are displayed in red, whereas hidden blocks and components are displayed in grey. Interoperability with INCA: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to establish a connection with a running INCA experiment. You get an integrated view on the algorithm specifications of a function (ASCET block diagram) and the values being measured in the INCA experiment. The values from a running INCA experiment for measurement variables and/or calibration parameters are displayed directly in the interactive model within the Model Viewer of the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. It is also possible to configure which of the measurement variables and/or calibration parameters, depicted in the interactive model, should display the values. Starting the visualization and stopping the measurement of an INCA experiment directly from the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is also supported. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR also helps to prepare the initial setup at your desk even if no hardware is connected to INCA. At the later stage, once the setup is ready, you can connect your system to hardware device and execute the experiments. Visualization of offline measurement: Now EHB is combined with already measured values and the time when it was measured. Compared to the live visualization where time moves forward at a constant pace (For example, a sample is taken every 250 ms), the offline visualization allows the calibration engineer to move back before the value changed to an unexpected value and he can investigate the cause. Either he can fix it by adjusting some calibration value (or even report a bug to the developer of the ECU software). Now, two cursors (Cursor A: and Cursor B:) are now available for offline measurement. You can also load the calibration files such as .a2l, .hex, .s19, .dcm, .cdfx, .xml, .dat, .mf3, or .mf4 to display the data (such as lower and upper limit, type and values (for calibration parameters)) in the Label pop-up. For this visualization of offline measurement, the newly added functionality called Measurement and Calibration Files in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows the calibration engineer to use the previously recorded data, e.g., with INCA. This feature helps the calibration engineer to get a better understanding of the functions and signal flows. MDA 8: Measure Data Analyzer 8 is also an ETAS Product which helps to visualize and analyze the measurement data. You can connect the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR through MDA 8 configuration. Connect feature in MDA 8 starts a new EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to display a corresponding documentation file (*.ehb) navigate between hierarchy model and model image of ASCET/Simulink model in the Document Viewer) for the currently loaded measurement file. It is also possible to request to show the documentation of a signal in MDA 8 in the currently loaded documentation. It searches globally for that particular signal and displays all the occurrences in EHB. It is possible to conduct an analysis in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR by updating the measurement file in MDA 8. ClickPic: Helps to navigate easily navigate between hierarchy model and model image of ASCET/Simulink model in the Document Viewer. Virtual Connections: The virtual connections are highlighted in the Interactive models (ASCET/Simulink/C-code models) and Function Overview diagrams. History: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR keeps a record of the recently viewed topics and models while exploring the content of an EHANDBOOK container. It provides you the benefit of viewing a list of previously visited locations and allows you to go back to any of those locations whenever necessary. The history is cleared when a new container is loaded. Printing: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to take print-outs of both the content and the interactive models. You may modify the page setup, if required before printing. Modifications include scaling, page orientation, page size, margins setup, etc.Display in System Tray: The EHANDBOOK- NAVIGATOR allows to customize such that it displays it in Windows System Tray when you close the Product Export as Image: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows to export the selected model or the function overview diagram as an image. Display values for the highlighted paths in the interactive models: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR displays values for the labels only for the highlighted signals. This helps to visualize only the right labels. Linking of the Hardware Devices: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports linking of the hardware devices either to a single device or multiple devices. This is needed while handling the visualization of the labels and values coming from INCA or from a measurement file. Extract content of EHANDBOOK container: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows to generate a new container by selecting the required function components from the loaded container. Export to PDF: The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to export the contents of a particular functional component to a PDF file. With the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, you are able to efficiently conduct a large variety of working tasks. Listed below are the benefits acquired by using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Information is found quickly and precisely, especially for measurement variables and calibration parameters. Documentation views can be switched for easier, working-task specific navigation. Understanding the functioning of the ECU software and functions is supported by means of graphical, interactive models. Bookmarks can be created to store the location of the container topics, sub- topics and interactive model for later retrieval. Comments can be added to specific portions of the Document Viewer. It can also be imported while importing another container into it. You can also copy the comment to the clipboard, which can be used in any other application by pasting it from the clipboard. Navigation is easy between hierarchy levels in complex ASCET block diagram models, Simulink models and C-Code derived models. Meta data details of the labels and other entities of Function Overview Diagrams, Interactive models and SVG images are shown in the Label popup. For the Curves and Maps, it is displayed in the 2D/3D view. Seamless overview on hierarchically nested functions is obtained through flattening of hierarchy levels. This is enabled by built-in innovative auto-layout algorithms. Built-in analysis algorithms allow calculating and highlighting dependencies in interactive models. This helps understand the dependencies between calibration parameters and measurement variables. Helps to debug ECU software and functions showing running values for measurement variables and calibration parameters from a connected INCA experiment. The calibration engineer uses the data which are recorded previously with the help of the Measurement and Calibration File which helps to visualize offline measurement. The calibration engineer can load measurement files (.dat/.mf3/.mf4) to display/view the recorded data in the interactive models. The calibration engineer can load calibration files (.a2l and .hex/.s19/.ptp) to display/view the data (such as lower and upper limit, type and values (for calibration parameters)) in the Label pop-up. Connecting from MDA 8 to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR helps the calibration engineer to inspect the values and refer the documentation which is loaded in EHB. You can also open the signal documentation in EHANDBOOK which helps to focus on the value and the documentation simultaneously. The calibration engineer can pass a measurement file from MDA 8 to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to conduct the analysis in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR using the same measurement data as loaded in MDA 8. This helps to understand better how the two applications are interoperate each other. Enabling the high screen resolution setting during installation displays the Model Viewer and the Function Overview Diagrams properly. Support of variant-coded labels Search functionality is improved such that the labels in the interactive models can be searched in the nested hierarchies. Displays the short name of a label in the Model Viewer. The values for Scalar Parameters and System Constants are annotated which helps to understated better. Supporting of the STRUCTURE data type in Simulink models establishes an end-to-end signal flow across two ECU functions via labels. Create a new function overview icon on the toolbar helps to create a new function overview diagram and also allows to edit it at any point of time. The external links when clicked provide a warning dialog for the user to choose either to open the URL in a default application like browser or file, otherwise to copy the same and use it for a different purpose. The navigation bar helps you to navigate through the models quickly. Please note that personal data is processed when using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR.

Affected container contents cannot be displayed or will be displayed incorrectly in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Therefore, always check the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build. Defective or inconsistent input data that have led to errors when converting will be tracked in the log file. The content consistency is in the responsibility of the data supplier (documentation publisher). We recommend that the data supplier develop a standard procedure for pre-processing the input data outside the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool chain to ensure the data consistency and to reduce the workload for reviewing the input data. In addition, the pre-processing should be properly documented to ensure transparency. After generating a new container: Check the entries in the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build indicating defective or inconsistent input data. If necessary, fix the incorrect or inconsistent input data. Re-build the EHANDBOOK Container. Only provide containers for further usage in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, if the log file contains no entries, indicating any defective or inconsistent input data. NOTICE Incomplete container content due to wrong or corrupt file formats Content of the generated EHANDBOOK Container may be incomplete, if the input data used for generating the container are not compliant to the following file formats: ASAM formats CCX FSX MDX Image formats JPG PNG EPS Formulas TeX Text formats AsciiDoc (supported subset) These container contents can not be displayed in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR.

Completing EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 12.1 Setup dialog box is displayed Once all components have been installed successfully, you are prompted to complete the installation. Click on Finish to complete the installation. On the Start menu, the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 12.1 folder, with the following entries, is created in the ETAS program group: EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 12.1 The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 12.1 program is started. Open Getting Started The Getting started guide of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is displayed. Release Notes The release notes of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is displayed. Uninstall EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR The uninstall procedure is started (see Uninstall Navigator) Search for License Management in the search field. The following icon is stored on the desktop of your workstation: If an error occurs during EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR installation, refer to the section Installation Error Codes to resolve the issue. A silent installation of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR may be invoked by executing the installer from the command line and by specifying additional parameters (see table below). Command Line Arguments for Silent Installation/Uninstallation: Installation Scenario Command Silent installation through command line EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR_12.1.0_setup.exe /S Note: EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR_12.1.0_setup.exe is the name of the file which you have downloaded Silent uninstall through command line uninstall.exe /S Note: uninstall.exe is located in the installation directory typically at C:\\ETAS\\EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 12.1 If an error occurs during the installation of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, you can refer to the section: Installation Error Codes in the Getting Started manual to resolve the issue. Customizing the installation directory is just an additional parameter: ´EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR_12.1.0_setup.exe /S /D=C:\\Custom\\EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR12.1´ EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR_12.1.0_setup.exe is the name of the file that you have downloaded. The path after /D= does not need any quotes (even if it contains spaces). The selected custom installation directory should be empty. The installation directory path must not exceed 80 characters for the installation to succeed. Enabling the high screen resolution setting by making it as true as shown below: /EnableSystemDPIAwareness=true Customizing the license configuration file by mentioning the path to the licensing.ini file: /LicenseConfigurationFile= Example: /LicenseConfigurationFile=D:\\licensing.ini The Product can be exited without getting minimized to system tray by making it as false as shown below: /MinimizeToTray=false The /DefaultLogPath= option sets the root folder for the log files generated during installation of other ETAS products which get installed along with EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR (For example: The ETAS license manager installed along with EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR). The value can be the name of an existing folder or if the path is not existing, it is created during the first setup. This works only when no other ETAS product has set this value before. The location of the workspace used by EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR can also be customized after the installation by modifying the configuration\\config.ini file in the installed directory. Note that the changes made to config.ini will be effective only after restarting the product. To specify a custom workspace location, the value for the “osgi.instance.area” argument in the .ini file should be modified. Example: osgi.instance.area=C:\\\\custom_install_dir\\\\EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR OR osgi.instance.area=C:/custom_install_dir/EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR Uninstallation will not automatically clean the workspace, if the workspace location has been customized. The installer assumes the workspace to be located in the default location. The Product can be customized such that when you close EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, it is still available and visible in the Windows System Tray. This can be done by adding the command, -DMinimizeToTray=True to the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR.ini file which is available in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR installation directory. The changes made to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR.ini file will be effective only after restarting the product. You can uninstall the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR product by the following method: Select Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features in the Control Panel. Select EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 12.1 and click Uninstall/Change. Start the uninstall procedure. The Windows Installer executes the uninstall process. Follow the instructions displayed on the window and confirm each window by clicking Next. After the uninstallation, if you find any folder starting with com.etas.mex created in the user’s directory e.g., C:\\Users\\\\.eclipse or in the programm data e.g., C:\\ProgramData\\ETAS\\EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR\\{navigator-version}\\.eclipse it can be safely removed. If an error occurs while uninstalling EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR refer to the section Installation Error Codes to resolve the issue. To be able to work with an ETAS software product, you require a license. This section contains basic details on this subject. ETAS License Models How to get a License The License File Request an Evaluation License The \"License expires soon\" Window Borrowing a License Details concerning the scope of the licenses and other legal aspects can be found in \"Terms and Conditions\". There are three different license models available for licensing your ETAS software: A license of this type is managed by the user him/herself. As it is linked to a particular PC. When you change your PC, you require a new license. The licenses (of a department or company) are managed centrally on a server by a designated person. The license is linked to the user name with which the user is registered in the network and is available on every PC in the network. If the relevant PC is disconnected from the network, the license can be \"borrowed\". Most of what is true of the user-named license applies to this type of license. The difference is that here several users share a limited number of licenses. If your company has a tool coordinator and server-based license management for ETAS software, contact this person. Otherwise (in the case of a machine-named license) you obtain your license from the ETAS license portal (the URL is shown on your Entitlement Certificate). There are three ways of logging in on the welcome page: Activation ID Once you have logged in, a specific activation is visible and can be managed the activation ID is shown on your Entitlement Certificate. Entitlement ID All activations of the entitlement are visible and can be managed (e.g. for a company with just one entitlement). E-mail and password All activations of entitlements assigned to the user account are visible and can be managed (e.g. for a tool coordinator responsible for several entitlements). If you need help in the portal, click the Help link. Information on the hosts must be entered to activate licenses: Machine-named license The MAC address of the Ethernet adapter to which the license is to be bound is required here. User-named license Here, you need a server host or a server triad as well as a user name. Concurrent (floating) license Here, you need a server host or a server triad. If this data changes (e.g. due to changes in the hardware or a change of user), the license must be given a \"rehost\". This procedure is also described in the portal help file. The result of your activities is the provision of a file .lic with which you can license your software in the ETAS License Manager. In the Windows Start menu, select ETAS → ETAS License Manager. The ETAS License Manager contains one entry for each installed product. The symbol at the beginning of the entry and the \"Status\" column entry indicate whether a valid license has already been obtained or not. Open the ETAS License Manager and select File → Add license file. The Add license file dialog window opens. Next to the Select License File field click the …​ button. In the file selection window, select the license file and click Open. The Install License dialog window shows information on the selected license. The \"Version\" column shows the version number of the license, not the version number of the software. Confirm with OK. The license just added is now listed in the ETAS License Manager. A green symbol before the entry shows that the license is valid. If the green symbol is not displayed, there might be a problem with the license file or the license relates to another product. Additional information on the ETAS License Manager can be found in the online help of the ETAS License Manager. Close the ETAS License Manager. EHANDBOOK NAVIGATOR does not support Grace mode. If you have not added a license file in the License Manager, you cannot work with the EHANDBOOK NAVIGATOR product. You need to obtain a valid license file to operate it. You can send a mail to ETAS sales (see ETAS Contacts) to obtain an Evaluation License. ETAS sales will generate an evalua- tion license and send it to you which will be valid for another 3 months of time. If you have not yet installed a license after the expiry, you can still operate the soft- ware with a few features disabled by obtaining a basic mode license; it then runs in what is referred to as basic mode. The window shows the warning message dis- played in this mode. Click Exit and manage license to open the ETAS License Manager and install a valid license file. As soon as you have installed a valid license, you can continue to operate the ETAS software in normal operating mode. Click Exit to close the dialog box and exit the ETAS software. If your installed license runs out in the next 30 days, a warning is shown when you open the ETAS software. The License expires soon window shows you the number of days left for the license to expire. The following warning messages are displayed indicating the expiration of license in 23 days, 1 day, and next day. Click Exit and manage lincense to open the ETAS License Manager and install a valid license file. As soon as you have installed a valid license, you can continue to operate the ETAS software in normal operating mode. Select Do not show again to stop displaying the License expires soon dialog box. Click Continue in full mode to close the dialog box and start the ETAS software. Once this phase is over, you can continue to use the ETAS software with a few features disabled in what is referred to as Basic Mode (see Basic Mode). All functionalities of the ETAS software are available only when a new or updated license file is installed. The borrowing mechanism makes it possible to work offline even when using a server-based license (i.e. without being connected to the license server). You can only borrow a license if a server-based license is being used! To borrow a license, proceed as follows: Make sure the ETAS software that you want to borrow the license for is not open. Select the license you want to borrow in the \"License Listing\" table of the ETAS License Manager. Select License → Borrow selected licenses. Select License → Borrow all licenses. The Select Borrow end date dialog box opens. Select the date until which you want to borrow the license from the calendar displayed and click OK. The text in the \"Source\" column of the ETAS License Manager changes from \"SERVER\" to \"BORROW\", and the expiration date of the borrowed license is displayed. You can now use the relevant ETAS software offline until the expiration date of the borrowed license has been reached. If you want to use the ETAS software longer than you had originally planned, you can borrow the license again. If you stop using the ETAS software earlier than planned, you can return the license to the license server early. (License → Return selected licenses License → Return all licenses). A borrowed license can only be returned by the person who borrowed it; it cannot be returned by another person.

Attachments are stored in EHANDBOOK Container files and shipped with them. Users of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR can open attachments to obtain additional information or data. When adopting EHANDBOOK, it is sometimes too hard to convert existing textual documentation contents (e.g. PDF or Word documents) to an EHANDBOOK input format (e.g. FSX or AsciiDoc). Instead of spending efforts on converting such contents, these can be added as attachments to a function documentation. Furthermore, there are various use cases where users of ECU software documentation can benefit from additional data or information, e.g. initial calibration data or automation scripts. However, this information is available in file formats that cannot be read with EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR or where it even does not make sense to view or read them in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR directly. On the other hand, it would be good for users to have all the information and data for an ECU function at a single place. Adding additional textual documentation as attachment to an EHANDBOOK Container saves time and effort to convert existing textual contents to an input format supported by EHANDBOOK. Rather than spending efforts, the contents can be directly added to the EHANDBOOK Container \"as-is\". Secondly, it is possible to enrich the EHANDBOOK Container with additional file-based information. Attachments can be distinguished into Documentation Contents and Complementary Information & Data. Documentation contents are contents which can be captured as documentation text in EHANDBOOK if the contents were provided by one of the supported input data formats (e.g., FSX or AsciiDoc). Documentation contents which are converted to EHANDBOOK internal format are shown in the built-in browser in a content tab. Complementary Information & Data are additional files which are typically not used directly in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The EHANDBOOK Container file acts as a structured and organized way to ship the information and data to users. The following table provides a list of examples. Documentation Contents Complementary information & data Textual documentation of ECU functions (e.g., function description) ECU software program files (.a2l and .hex/.s19) Calibration data files with initial or neutral calibration data (.dcm, .cdfx) Automation scripts (e.g., INCA Flow scripts, Matlab scripts, etc.) Additional training documents (e.g., calibration guides) (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel) In EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, attachments are shown as part of the chapters in the selected table of contents. For each documentation chapter which has additional attachments, an entry Attachments is added. This entry contains the attached files as a list. The name of the entry corresponds to the file name of the attachment as provided to EHANDBOOK Container-Build. The icon of the attachment entry is provided by your operating system. You can open an attachment by left-clicking on the corresponding entry with the mouse, right-clicking on the entry and selecting Open attachment from the context menu or hitting the key when the entry is selected You can save an attachment by right-clicking on the entry and selecting Save attachment from the context menu. Duplicate files are not supported by attachments. For example, if you specify two ABLOCKS with category ATTACHMENTS and associate both ABLOCKS with the same function component, then any duplicate attachment files will be ignored.

It has an overall automatic sequence control system for the integrated converters and generators and administrate the meta database and data intelligence. The database is basis for label pop-up, search proposal and function overview feature in EHB-NAV. To allow these functionalities, EHB-CB interprets further information (metadata like imported/exported/local, compu-method, data-type, …) about parameters, variables and system constants. This content is parsed out of the AUTOSAR-Classic arxml-files or MDX-files (ASAM based EHB-CB) or out of the XLSX-files (directory based EHB-CB). The EHB-CB generates a special database with this data and puts it into the EHB container. Also per ECU function the standard chapter “Systemconstant-Parameter-Variable-Structure“ with the corresponding tables is created. EHB-CB tags all labels in the textual content (FSX-, adoc- or RTF-files). The mapping procedure for the function overview is purely named based, which means the name of a parameter or variable that is exported by one function has to be the same for the function that is importing it. This implies also, that every label name has to be unique. That is the same paradigm as in the existing a2l specification. The EHB-CB provides an own vector graphics generator, to generate images in SVG format out of interactive model hierarchies for ASCET and Simulink and creates links between them. The framework can be used via a small GUI or headless via command line parameters to allow automated integration into documentation build processes. Further build process steps: Auto tagging for textual content construct of meta database for variables and parameters (If model interface description is provided as MDX, XLSX or ARXML) Processing of text styling Creation of search index out of textual and interactive model contents Packaging and zipping of all content into EHB container format The entire data sources, like models, texts, graphics and interface data have to be structured in a given way. EHB-CB allows two different types of input structures: file directory or ASAM based. Only one type can be used per EHB-CB framework. This framework is capable to generate EHB containers out of a given file directory input. The table of contents is created from the directory structure The optional RTF or ADOC file converters parse the textual content for every ECU function and creates references to images and models The optional XLS-file converter or arxml-AUTOSAR-Classic converter parses the model interface data and its parameters and variables The optional PDF file converter can generate documentation with PDF as source. For further, refer Support for PDF files in Directory Based EHB-CB For the required file format details, please refer to the ADOC/RTF/XLS Specification for EHB-CB documents. These documents are located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. This framework is capable to generate EHB containers out of the ASAM Exchange files standard. For each type of the standard, an adequate converter is provided: The CCX-converter for parsing the container catalog file, which contains the table of content and all references to FSX/MDX and models & graphics The FSX-converter for parsing the function specification files, which contain the textual descriptions and structure and references to images and models The MDX- or arxml-AUTOSAR-Classic-converter for parsing the model data files, which contain the function interface descriptions The optional PDF file converter can generate documentation with PDF as source. For further, refer Support for PDF files in ASAM-based EHB-CB For the required ASAM file format details, please refer to the ASAM Specification for EHB-CB document, which is located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. The Unified Graphics Generator tool (UGG) is capable to pre-generate interactive models, SVG images and map files out of Simulink or ASCET models. These artifacts are then read in by the EHB-CB and will speed-up the container generation process dramatically. The UGG can be ordered as a separate SW package. ETAS offers the following toolboxes as separate SW packages: Toolbox for Simulink: allows container generation for one model directly out of Simulink Toolbox for ASCET: allows container generation directly out of ASCET V6/V7 Multiple converters, generator plug-ins and functionalities can extend each EHB-CB framework.

They form the fundamental building blocks in EHANDBOOK. The description of functions sre stored in EHANDBOOK Container files. An EHANDBOOK Container can contain one or multiple functions. And EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR can load one or multiple EHANDBOOK Containers and allow the user to explore all functions seamlessly. For EHANDBOOK Container-Build, the input data for a function typically comprises an interface and label description an algorithm specification in the form of an ASCET or Simulink/Stateflow model, or alternatively the algorithms implementation in C-Code a textual description to explain details of what the function does At least one of the above is required to as content for a documentation unit in EHANDBOOK. If the documentation unit contains an interface and label description, it constitutes a function. Figure 1. EHANDBOOK Container-Build Principles Each function has an interface and label description. The interface description comprises the inputs and outputs through which it is connected to other functions. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR can visualize functions and their connetions in the form of a function overview diagram as shown below. Besides the interface description, functions can also further labels such as local signals that can be measured within the function as well as parameters which can be calibration, e.g. with ETAS INCA. While local signals as well as parameters are not visible on in the function overview diagram, they still clearly belong to the function. Typically, they are part of the algorithm specification of the function. The internal behavior of functions is either specified using a model-based development tool such as ETAS ASCET or Simulink/Stateflow from TheMathworks or directly implemented in C-code. For the documentation of an ECU software, the graphical depcitions of block diagram models and state charts are valuable for users who want to understand the algorithm as they show the data and control flow in the form of a picture. For control-engineers and non-software-developers, graphical depictions are often preferred compared to source code that can be hard to read and understand. EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools can convert ASCET models as well as Simulink models to EHANDBOOK’s so-called interactive models. The interactive models can then be integrated within the functions interface description. The textual description for a function is typically a chapter with multiple sections. In many cases, screenshots of block diagram models and state charts are embedded and described in the text. The following screenshot shows a picture of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR.","title":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build Principles","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"ehandbook_container_build_principles","url":"/ehandbook/explanations/ehandbook_container_build_principles.html","titles":[{"text":"Interface and label description","hash":"_interface_and_label_description","id":1},{"text":"Algorithm specification (ASCET or Simulink model) or implementation (C-code)","hash":"_algorithm_specification_ascet_or_simulink_model_or_implementation_c_code","id":2},{"text":"Textual description","hash":"_textual_description","id":3}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build Tools are 64-bit applications.

EHANDBOOK Container-Build Tool-Chain EHANDBOOK Container-Build Toolboxes and Add-Ons A2L files The EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool-chain is a tool-chain available for different platforms (e.g., Microsoft Windows, Linux) to generate EHANDBOOK Containers from different sources (e.g., ASCET 6/7 models, Simulink models, C-Code). Through its command-line interface (CLI), the tool-chain can be used to automate builds in different environments. There are two approaches for how to provide input data for EHANDBOOK Container-Build: ASAM-based input data: In this approach, the input data is provided as XML files in formats which have been standardized by the Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems (ASAM). The standards relevant for ETAS EHANDBOOK are Container Catalog format specification (CC), the function specification exchange format specification (FSX) and the meta-data exchange format specification (MDX). Directory-based input data: In this approach, the input data is provided as files which are organized in a directory structure according to conventions specified by EHANDBOOK. If you are not using ASAM-based exchange formats yet, we recommend to get started with the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build approach first. Besides the general tool-chain, there are add-ons / toolboxes for ASCET 6, ASCET-DEVELOPER as well as a MATLAB/Simulink that directly integrate into these tools. Through the direct tool integration, EHANDBOOK Containers can be generated from an opened model via the user interface of the host tool. The EHANDBOOK Container-Build Toolbox for Simulink can convert a single Simulink model (which represens an individual ECU function or software component) to an EHANDBOOK Container.

There is the request, that the interactive ASCET model of a function only contains sub hierarchies for which an image screenshot in the documentation is also available. However, to allow a continuous model navigation, also intermediate hierarchies without documentation has to be handled and shown in an appropriate way. Example: White list [H1, H3]: Hierarchies whose image screenshots are present in the documentation. Intermediate list [H2]: Hierarchies whose parent [H1] is a white listed hierarchy and whose one or more child hierarchies [H3] are also white listed. But H2 is not present in the documentation. To allow now a model navigation from H1 to H3, H2 will be still shown, but its contents of it are filtered out to maintain minimalist information. Without the option -ihf, only H1 will be part of the interactive model. The ihf feature is only an emergency solution and has some limitations. The better way would be to use the build-in view mechanisms of ASCET upfront, see chapter View Concept Known limitations: SVG image will not be generated for filtered sub-hierarchies. For resolving all white listed class definition paths with “ihf” the model conversion may take significantly longer. The time increases exponentially as the number of references and *.amd files increases. If the ASCET model contains about 1000 references (Class instance entries) the time is increased by a factor of 5 and if model has more than 150 *.amd file entries the time is increased by a factor of 10. Typically, an ASCET, ASCET-DEVELOPER or Simulink model starts with some first wrapping hierarchies, which were of no interest to the EHB-NAV user. In addition, for the seamless function wallpaper feature, it just wastes space and makes it complex. Therefore, EHB-CB provides the flexibility to change the entry level of a model type (ASCET, ASCET-DEVELOPER, SIMULINK) by using a JSON configuration file. Considering the example below without skipping: Figure 1. Since level (1) and (2) does not contain any information the user can directly view level (3) of the model using this feature. Same example with skipping of the first two root levels: With the JSON file shown below (plain ASCII format), all ASCET models in the container are opened with its 2nd and ASCET-DEVELOPER, SIMULINK with 1st level. { \"rootLevel\": { \"ASCET\": \"2\", \"Simulink\": \"1\", \"ASCET-DEVELOPER\": \"1\", } } Conditions for level skipping: Level exceeds In case the level specified in JSON file is exceeding the one available in the model, then the tool stops at the last available level in the model. Multiple sub levels in parallel In case of multiple expandable sub levels exist in an upper level, the tool stops at the immediate parent level, as there is a conflict of unambiguousness. To activate this feature, the command line option -rootlevel “path_to_jsonfile\\name.json” has to be provided. A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\configuration\\RootLevel.json) For the C-Code models, root-level skip cannot be applied. This feature is sold as a separate option on request and is not part of the standard EHB-CB tool. Encrypted containers can be generated by using the command parameter -epwd or -epwdf. The password can be passed either in the command line e.g. -epwd \"qwertz\" or within a password file e.g. -epwdf ./my_password_file.txt. If using a separate password file, the password must be surrounded with % characters e.g. %my_secret% as content of the password file. The password file is deleted after container encryption. The password should satisfy the following credentials: Password length: minimum 4; maximum 255 characters Password characters: alphanumeric, special characters are allowed Password pattern: No special pattern is required The container gets the new file extension .ehbcrypt. It can be opened in the EHB-NAV in the same way. But after section of the container file, the user will be prompted for the correct password to be typed in. EHANDBOOK Container-Build is capable to generate graphics out of a model and link it with its corresponding interactive model hierarchy. In addition, these graphics are linked between each others in the Function Documentation Window in EHB-NAV, the so called ClickPic navigation feature. To visualize these graphics, some special keywords have to be added in the text source files. RTF input files: [ehbmodelref] Model hierarchy path in text style of type “Caption” AsciiDoc input files: ehbmodelref::model_path[image_title] ASAM input files: In FSX, the FIGURE’s for the model graphic contains the model hierarchy path directly in a mandatory format i.e. “X.Y.Z”. More details about this can be found in the separate specification documents, which are located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. To allow EHB-CB generated graphics and ClickPic containers must be generated by using the command parameter -gensvg, otherwise this feature will not work! Figure 2. Navigable blocks indicated by arrow and orange frame NOTICE Incomplete, wrong or differing representation of model screenshots and interactive models from source data. During the conversion of ASCET models, Simulink/Stateflow models or C-Code to interactive models and/or SVG graphics, the generated outputs may differ from the original model visualizations. As C-Code is written in textual form while interactive models are graphical diagrams, the semantic and interpretation can differ. The following deviations between the model and the EHANDBOOK Container content may occur: Missing or wrong graphics Wrong targets on linked graphics Wrong model links Wrong model hierarchy links For C-Code visualizations, different interpretations and semantics Possible root causes of these deviations are: Link specification in input text does not match to model hierachy path Referenced model/source files are missing Matlab connection for mask generation in Simulink was broken, EHB-CB tool error due to internal error or unsupported source content Technical limitations, especially for representing C-Code as graphical visualization To identify deviations: Check the entries in the log file of the generated EHANDBOOK Container for Warnings and Errors Check the links between SVG graphics and interactive models in the EHANDBOOK Container It is the responsibility of the creator of the EHANDBOOK Container to check the log files generated by EHANDBOOK Container-Build and to check the outputs for wrong model references and initiate the correction in the sources. To ensure consistency and mitigate limitations: Check the release notes and the known issues of EHANDBOOK Container-Build as well as EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Compare the C-Code source code with the its graphical representation in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. For know-how protection purposes, ASCET allows designing the models for different views, e.g. it is possible to hide some element for a defined view. EHB supports this concept. With the command line option -viewtype “ViewName” you are setting, for which view the model and its screenshots should be generated. The command line option -ascetview “config-file.xml” locates the file, where for every view name the corresponding model appearance is configured in a given format. You can export a view file from ASCET: Tools (ASCET Main Window) Views → Select the view names to be exported (multiple selection allowed) → Click Export button and choose destination and name of the file. The following elements are supported in EHB for the views: ASCET View contents Support in EHB BDE Settings Show Unused Sequence Calls Show Used Sequence Calls Show Graphical Comments Show Process Name Locals All settings supported Default settings for Elements As Line Invisible Contour Hide Contents Element properties of type ‘Implementation Cast’ is supported only Documentation Settings Not Implemented In ASAM-CCX, you can also define a view name in the tag Name. It supersedes the command line option -viewtype. For details, please refer to the document ASAM Format Specification for EHB, which is located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. The view name provided by -viewtype has to match to the view name specified in corresponding view file, otherwise no view is applied. For c-code the same method is used with the parameter -ccodeview “config-file.xml”. Here the same xml format as for ASCET is used, but you can only specify, if process sequence calls are visible in the interactive model or not. These calls are showing the computation order of the c-code. Sample files are available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\configuration\\AscetFiguresView.xml, CCodeViews.xml) For know-how protection reasons or for a better readability, Simulink blocks that are based on subsystems can be specified as non-expandable for interactive models in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR during EHANDBOOK Container generation. To enable the global configuration feature, the command line option -simulinkview (CB) or -simulinkviewfile (UGG) that takes \"path_to_jsonfile\\name.json\" as argument is used. The JSON file specifies the behavior of the blocks then, see samples below. Makes referenced blocks with masks non-expandable (e.g. libraries): { \"GlobalView\": { \"HideContents\": [ { \"BlockType\": \"Reference\", \"Simulink.Mask\": \"true\" } ] } } Makes all subsystems with masks non-expandable: { \"GlobalView\": { \"HideContents\": [ { \"BlockType\": \"SubSystem\", \"Simulink.Mask\": \"true\" } ] } } Makes any masked Simulink block non-expandable: { \"GlobalView\": { \"HideContents\": [ { \"Simulink.Mask\": \"true\" } ] } } Makes any subsystem non-expandable: { \"GlobalView\": { \"HideContents\": [ { \"BlockType\": \"SubSystem\" } ] } } A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\configuration\\SimulinkGlobalView.json) The feature above works only if the key word Simulink.Mask is used inside the model file. This is the case for MATLAB 2012b onwards. For older versions (2012a and below) the key word MaskDisplay is used, which is currently not supported. Model depth skip can be used to convert all Simulink models till a particular model hierarchy level starting from the root level. This may be useful, to hide know-sensitive information in deeper model hierarchies. For this feature, the same command line parameter -simulinkview and JSON file as for the feature above is used. In this JSON file, an additional section “ModelDepth” with the required level can be provided: { \"GlobalView\": { \"ModelDepth\" : 5 } } “ModelDepth” value must be in integers. In this example, all Simulink models within a container will be converted up to 5 levels from the root level. Several features of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR are based on the notion that the label names visible in interactive models correspond to label names in an A2L file. Also the function overview in NAV works purely name based. This means, the variable name from an exporting function has to match to the name of the importing function. There can be cases, however, where the strings that are visible in an ASCET or Simulink model do not directly correspond to an A2L label name or match between functions. In this case, features like label pop-up, INCA visualization or function overview will not work in EHB-NAV. By means of amending the names of labels in interactive models and the generated screenshots, models and screenshots can be \"patched\" such that the visible strings do match the expected A2L label names. It works in such a way that during the generation of an interactive model from a source ASCET or Simulink model the strings resembling label names are analyzed and transformed according to a specific set of rules. The rules are specified in a JSON file and passed via an argument to EHB-CB or UGG. The command line parameter is -labelamendment with “path_to_json_file/name.json” as argument. The rules for renaming are specified in a JSON file format: Exact Replacements Exact replacements are specified as key-value pairs of strings in rule groups marked with the key word \"exact\". They work straight-forward - the string in the key is replaced by the string in the value: “Original_Name” : “New_Name” Here’s an example for a set of exact replacement rules: { \"exact\": { \"Epm_rpmEngSpd_Sim_changed\" : \"Epm_rpmEngSpd_Sim\", \"Two-point-controller_changed\" : \"Two-point-controller\", \"Lamsoni_Sim_changed\" : \"Lamsoni_Sim\" } } Pattern-based Replacements Pattern-based replacement are specified as key value pairs of strings in rule groups marked with the key word \"pattern\". The keys make use of regular expressions to match strings that shall be amended. The values denote replacement strings. The latter can make use of the match groups defined in the regular expression. “Target_Pattern” : “Substitude_Pattern” Here’s an example for a set of pattern based replacement rules: { \"pattern\": { \"(.*)_write\": \"$1\", \"read_(.*)\": \"$1\", \"read_(.*)_write\": \"$1\", \"(.*)_middle_(.*)\": \"$1_$2\" } } If the single character ‘.’ is used for a regular expression it must be escaped by ‘\\\\’ \"prefix_(.*)\\\\.postfix\" : \"$1_postfix\", Here a sample Internet page with further information about regular expressions in general and online testing possibilities: https://freeformatter.com/regex-tester.html Order in which replacements are applied The order of rules as well as rule groups is of relevance. Rules within a rule group are applied in sequence. The same applies to rule groups; they are also applied in the sequence specified in the JSON file. Through this, even multiple rules can be applied during a transformation. A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\configuration\\LabelAmendment.json) On application of label amendment to model hierarchies, clickPic for backward navigation and “open interactive model” does not work! Two command line parameters could be used to provide SIMULINK library paths as input for the container generation. simlib Provide folder paths enclosed within double quotes separated by commas. Example: -simlib \"path1,path2,path3\" simlibfile Provide path to json file containing paths to all libraries required. Example: -simlibfile \"path_to_json_file\" The key property in the json file used is \"libraryPaths\". Here’s an example of the JSON file: { \"libraryPaths\": [ \"path1\", \"path2\", \"path3\" ] } EHB-CB is capable to generate a Function Overview Diagram with all input- and output signals automatically. Besides one single function, there are also multiple functions possible, showing the dependency and relation between them. The generated Function Overview diagram will appear in EHB-NAV in the Function Documentation Window with a new navigation button named “Open function overview”. On click of this button, the model explorer tab opens with combined Function Overview of the functions appearing the image. The separate chapters Function Overview Diagram in the TOC of EHB-NAV are generated by default without any additional configurations during container generation, independent of this feature. Required changes to achieve this functionality are described in the separate documents RTF format Specification and AsciiDoc format Specification for directory based EHB-CB and in ASAM format Specification for the ASAM based EHB-CB. These documents are located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. Creating function overviews with > 30 functions is not advised as all the functions might not fit into canvas. EHANDBOOK supports configuration of structure data types for Simulink. Structures are mapped to Simulink buses. Structures can be defined in MDX following the MDX specification. For details please refer to the document ASAM Format Specification for EHB-CB, which is located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. The visualization of C-Code as block diagram can be customized through several configurations. These can be adapted in such a way that the program logic is represented more precisely and that the graphical visualization can be understood more easily. The configuration options are provided through a central configuration file in XML format. The configuration file is to be passed using the command-line option -ccodemeta with “path_to_meta_file/name.xml” as argument. The following shows the XML template for the C-Code configuration options. The configuration options are described in the following: libraryPath For a given ECU function, having a set of C-files with implementations, the C-functions call other C-functions as sub-routines or service routines. A suitable way to arrange such ECU specific C-files and global sub-routines is to configure where C-files for ECU functions are placed, and where the global sub-routines are placed. This configuration specifies the location of all such global sub-routines or other C functions which could be present in a true either .c files or .h files. These files typically contain helper or utility functions for the ECU specific C-files. inlineFunctions This configuration can be set to true/false in order to enable/disable the graphical inlining of called C-functions into the context of the calling C-functions. Default setting: inlineFunctions=false If set to true, the model visualizes the called function (e.g. global sub-routine/other C functions) as an expandable block within the block of the calling function. For clearness, the Inlined C-functions are removed from the top level. Therefore, no model screenshots for these functions can created via -gensvg. Example: The C-function mul is called from C-function main. If set to false, the model visualizes the called function (e.g. global sub-routine/other C functions) as non-expandable block within the block of the calling function. Note that the called functions are visualized as top-level expandable blocks. This configuration can be used to obtain visualizations of C-libraries, for example. Example: simplifyDiagram This configuration takes in a true/false to enable/disable simplification of C-Code model. When enabled, unused variables and code from visualization are omitted, thereby decluttering and consequently simplifying the model visualization. However, the simplification can be disabled to view the actual model aiding in verifying the correctness of the model in comparison to the original source code, if required. Default setting: simplifyDiagram=true generateHierarchies This configuration takes in a true/false to enable/disable artificial hierarchies in C-Code model. When enabled, artificial hierarchies are placed to logically group the elements. However, it could be disabled to have no hierarchies and view the model as it is in the original source code. Default setting: generateHierarchies=true Below, is an image depicting artificial hierarchies being created in the upper part. Here “True” which is expanded to show the contents, is an artificial hierarchy. The bottom part of the image shows C-code model with hierarchy generation being disabled, hence appears flat. maxIterationForDataflowAnalysis C-Code is converted to a data structure, which can be visualized as block diagram. A part of the underlying algorithm is to calculate the connections between the blocks that represent the variables and operators of the C code functions. This is referred to as “Dataflow Analysis”. maxIterationForDataflowAnalysis is a configuration parameter to tweak the calculation of the connections through an iterative Dataflow Analysis. A too high value can lead to high memory consumption and longer runtime than necessary in order to calculate all connections. A too low value can result is unconnected blocks due to missing connections. The algorithm terminates before all connections have been calculated. The value should be chosen such that it represents the minimal number of iterations even for the most complex C-code sources of a given ECU program. Default setting: maxIterationForDataflowAnalysis=50000 A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\configuration\\CCodeConfig.xml) When maxIterationForDataflowAnalysis is exceeded, an \"Error\" will be logged in the log file. NOTICE Incomplete, wrong or differing representation of model screenshots and interactive models from source data. During the conversion of ASCET models, Simulink/Stateflow models or C-Code to interactive models and/or SVG graphics, the generated outputs may differ from the original model visualizations. As C-Code is written in textual form while interactive models are graphical diagrams, the semantic and interpretation can differ. The following deviations between the model and the EHANDBOOK Container content may occur: Missing or wrong graphics Wrong targets on linked graphics Wrong model links Wrong model hierarchy links For C-Code visualizations, different interpretations and semantics Possible root causes of these deviations are: Link specification in input text does not match to model hierachy path Referenced model/source files are missing Matlab connection for mask generation in Simulink was broken, EHB-CB tool error due to internal error or unsupported source content Technical limitations, especially for representing C-Code as graphical visualization To identify deviations: Check the entries in the log file of the generated EHANDBOOK Container for Warnings and Errors Check the links between SVG graphics and interactive models in the EHANDBOOK Container It is the responsibility of the creator of the EHANDBOOK Container to check the log files generated by EHANDBOOK Container-Build and to check the outputs for wrong model references and initiate the correction in the sources. To ensure consistency and mitigate limitations: Check the release notes and the known issues of EHANDBOOK Container-Build as well as EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Compare the C-Code source code with the its graphical representation in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Per FC, there is always one generic chapter with the default name Systemconstant-Parameter-Variable-Classinstance-Structure. This chapter contains the tables for all the elements, which are specified in the corresponding MDX, ARXML or xls-file. The name of the chapter and the appearance of the tables can be configured with the command line parameter -tableconfig “file_path\\file.json”. The JSON file defines the view as follows: { \"chapter\": \"Name of the chapter in EHB-NAV\", \"tables\": [ { \"title\": \"Variable\", \"filters\": [ { \"id\": \"ehb_element_type\", \"value\": \"ehb_variable\" } ], \"columns\": [ { \"title\": \"Name\", \"id\": \"ehb_name\", \"width\": \"20%\" }, { \"title\": \"Description\", \"id\": \"ehb_desc\", \"width\": \"40%\" }, { \"title\": \"Unit\", \"id\": \"Unit\", \"width\": \"10%\" }, { \"title\": \"Data Type\", \"id\": \"Type\", \"width\": \"10%\" }, { \"title\": \"Mode\", \"id\": \"ehb_mode\", \"width\": \"20%\" } ] }, { \"title\": \"Calibration/Parameter\", \"filters\": [ { \"id\": \"ehb_element_type\", \"value\": \"ehb_parameter\" } ], \"columns\": [ { \"...\": \"...\" } ] } ] } The “tables”: [] section defines the appearance of each table. Each table begins with a title entry: “title”: “Name of the table title in EHB-NAV” In the section “filters”: [ “id”: “ehb_element_type” you specify the table element type by defining one of the following key words for “value”: Type of table Matching key words for “value”: “…​” Corresponding entry in xls Corresponding entry in MDX Corresponding entry in ARXML Variables Parameters System Constants Class Instances Sender Receiver Interface Parameter Interface Client Server Interface “ehb_variable” “ehb_parameter” “ehb_system_constant” “ehb_class_instance” “ehb_variable” “ehb_parameter” \"ehb_autosar_csport\" Sheet “Signal” Sheet “Calibration” N.A. N.A. N.A N.A N.A N.A N.A N.A N.A N.A N.A N.A In the section “columns”: [ ] per column entry, a “title” & “id” pair defines the column content: “title”: “column name” defines the name of the column in EHB-NAV “id”: “Input source value from MDX, ARXML or xls to be shown”. “width”: Defines width of the table column that can be configured in PDF. “width” is denoted in percentage. For the “id” values, fixed pre-defined key words are used: Key word for “id”: “…​” in JSON Corresponds to column in xls Corresponds to key word in MDX “ehb_name” “Name” “ehb_desc” “Description” “ehb_mode” “Xref” No tag avail. “ehb_access” N.A. “ehb_data_type” “Class” “ehb_reference” N.A. No tag avail. used for class instance table only “ehb_category” N.A. Entry in For other element properties, defined in further column entries in the xls file, the identical name is used in the JSON file as “id” value also. The same applies for MDX entries used for properties. You can define as many “title” & “id” pairs as you want, but you have to consider the page width in EHB-NAV and especially in PDF if printing is required. The order of the “title” & “id” pairs in the JSON file are defining the order of the columns in EHB-NAV from left to right. The order of the tables in the JSON file are defining the order of the tables in EHB-NAV from top to bottom. You can divide the tables into different ones by adding additional filter attributes. \"title\": \"Input Variables\", \"filters\": [ { \"id\": \"ehb_element_type\", \"value\": \"ehb_variable\" }, { \"id\": \"ehb_mode\", \"value\": \"import\" }, { \"...\" : \"...\" } ] A filter criterion can be configured as “id” & “value” pairs “id”: “type” defines the type for the filtering “value”: “value of type” defines the content of type, which should match the filter criteria For “type” and “value” fixed pre-defined key words are used: Key word for “id”: “…​” Matching key words for “value”: “…​” Corresponding entry in xls Corresponding entry in MDX Corresponding entry in ARXML “ehb_mode” “import” “export” “local” IN OUT LOC N.A For other element properties required for as filter criterion, the corresponding column entry in the xls file can be used. Here the identical column name is required in the JSON file as “id”: “type” also. In addition, the text entry in the column must be identical in the JSON “value”: “text entry”. The same applies for MDX and ARXML entries used for filtering. Multiple filter criteria can be used. They are combined as logical AND, e.g. element_type=variable & mode=exported & type=float. You can define as many tables as you want, with any combination of filters, but limited to the pre-defined key words like ehb_element_type and ehb_mode. Additionally values from multiple columns can be filtered by the key named \"values\". Here, multiple values which shall be included in the table entry can be added. Depending on the use case, either the key \"value\" or the key \"values\" or both can be used. In the below example, the table can have the entries which match the category as R-PORT or STRUCTURE or VALUE. \"title\": \"Input Variables\", \"filters\": [ { \"id\": \"ehb_element_type\", \"value\": \"ehb_variable\" }, { \"id\": \"ehb_mode\", \"value\": \"import\" }, { \"id\": \"ehb_category\", \"values\": [ \"R-PORT\", \"STRUCTURE\", \"VALUE\" ] } ] It is recommended to use \"value\" for filtering exactly one value. In case of multiple values required to be included in the filter, the key word \"values\" to be used. If both key words (\"value\" and \"values\") are used then filtering will be a combination of both. All key words and value entries are handled case insensitive but have to be exact. There is no error handling for wrongly spelled entries. A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\configuration\\TableConfiguration.json) In a model, you have multiple possibilities how to name a label. The tools ASCET 6 and ASCET-DEVELOPER provide certain options to configure the composition of an element name. E.g. the element name can be appended with their parent elements and the order of the name parts can be defined. So the name may differ from the name in the a2l file and MCD features like INCA connectivity will not work. Therefore, EHB-CB provides the flexibility to configure the label names by using a JSON configuration file (plain ASCII, UTF8 format), so that it matches the names in A2L file. There is one single JSON file with individual configuration possibilites per model type (ASCET 6, ASCET DEVELOPER, Simulink) See sample LabelConfig.json in the sub folder .\\examples\\configuration of your EHB-CB installation directory. Please ensure, that the configuration parameters in ASCET and in the JSON file are matching. Otherwise labels from a2l-file or from INCA could not be shown in EHB-NAV. The element name could be placed first or last, when appended with their parent elements or package names could be omitted. With the JSON file shown below (plain ASCII, UTF8 format), ASCET-DEVELOPER models in the container will have the element name placed last and will not be appended with the package name. This is also the default, if no label configuration is provided. { \"ASCET-DEVELOPER\": { \"elementNameFirst\": false, \"includePackageName\": false } } For example, a class element “signal” within class “Component”, placed inside package “components” would have the name as in the below table according to the various combinations provide in JSON file. This name is used to connect to INCA on EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. includePackageName elementNameFirst true false true signal.Component.components components.Component.signal false signal.Component Component.signal In the above JSON file, ‘elementNameFirst’ parameter corresponds to the ‘Model symbolic name format’ in the ASAM MCD section under the ‘ASAM’ tab in the launch configuration for ECU code generation in ASCET-DEVELOPER tool as shown below: While the ‘includePackageName’ corresponds to the ‘Legacy code generation’ option in ‘Naming convention’ section under the ‘Options’ tab in the run configuration as shown below: If the checkbox is selected, then ASCET Classic naming convention is used where the package names are omitted, while de-selecting it will have the package name being included in the label. The element names could be placed first or last and their parent elements module and project names or their class instance names could be appended also. With the JSON file shown below, models in the container will have the element name placed last and will be appended with the class instance names. This is also the default, if no label configuration is provided. { \"ASCET\": { \"elementNameFirst\": false, \"includeModuleName\": false, \"includeProjectName\": false, \"includeClassInstanceName\": true } } For example, an instance “componentInstance” of class “Component” having a class element “signal”, placed within a module “RootModule” of project “Project” would have the name as in the below table according to the various combinations provide in JSON file. This name is used to connect to INCA on EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. includeProjectName elementNameFirst includeModuleName true false true signal.componentInstance.RootModule.Project Project.RootModule.componentInstance.signal true false signal.componentInstance componentInstance.signal false EHB-CB provides the option to add a configurable and invisible unique name to blocks and buses in the Simulink model. This hidden unique name is then used for MCD features like INCA connectivity in EHB-NAV. With the JSON file shown below, Simulink blocks of block type \"Constant\" will have label configured via uniqueName. { \"Simulink\": { \"blockRules\": [ { \"selectors\": [ { \"parameter\": \"BlockType\", \"value\": \"Constant\" } ], \"uniqueName\": \"${Value}\" } ] } } JSON file path has to be given as an argument for command-line parameter \"-labelconfig\" { \"Simulink\": { \"blockRules\": [ { \"selectors\": [ { \"parameter\": \"BlockType\", \"value\": \"Inport\" } ], \"replacements\": [ { \"parameter\": \"Name\", \"regex\": \"(.*)\", \"replacement\": \"$1__TestSuffix\" } ], \"uniqueName\": \"Test_prefix.${Name}\" } ], \"nonVirtualBusRules\": [ { \"busNameSelector\": { \"value\": \"signalBus\" }, \"busElementNameSelector\": { \"regex\": \"signal__(.*)\" }, \"busNameReplacement\": { \"regex\": \"prefix_(.*)_suffix\", \"replacement\": \"$1\" }, \"busElementNameReplacement\": { \"regex\": \"(.*)__(.*)\", \"replacement\": \"$1\" }, \"uniqueName\": \"${busNameReplacement}.${busElementNameReplacement}\" } ] } } BlockRules assist to configure uniqueName for any type of Simulink blocks based on selectors and replacements configurations. It is possible to provide list of blockRules [0…​n]. selectors are filters that are applied to select the block based on the provided key-value pairs. Key Value Optional parameter Valid Simulink block parameter No value Simulink block parameter value Yes regex Simulink block parameter value regex pattern Yes selectors are composed of either parameter and value combination or parameter and regex combination. It is possible to provide list of selectors [0…​n]. If a blockRule does not contain any selectors, then a uniqueName will be created for all the blocks. To construct a uniqueName from blockRules, all the defined selectors have to be satisfied. replacements are optional. Key Value Optional parameter Valid Simulink block parameter No regex Simulink block parameter value regex pattern No replacement Prepare an unique name using regex groups or text No A replacement is composed of \"parameter\" and \"regex\" applied on \"parameter\". Example: \"replacements\": [ { \"parameter\": \"Name\", (1) \"regex\": \"(.*)\", (2) \"replacement\": \"$1__Suffix\" (3) } ] 1 \"parameter\" key has the value as \"Name\"(which is a Simulink block name) 2 The key \"regex\" has a pattern which will be applied on this Simulink block name to match all the characters of this name. 3 The \"replacement\" key’s value will replace the matched characters with the replacement value(in the example \"parameter\" is appended by _Suffix ⇒ Name_Suffix) The resultant value after \"replacement\" will be used as expression in the uniqueName. The uniqueName key is mandatory, and corresponding labels are only created if \"uniqueName\" is provided in the JSON configuration file. uniqueName is composed of fixed expressions or text uniqueName is composed of expressions, where each expression starts with \"$\" followed by \"{\" and ends with \"}\". Examples for uniqueName: $\\{Sample1}_$\\{Sample2}_suffix (1) 1 Sample1, Sample2 here are place-holders for block parameter values defined inside the model. If the replacements are provided for Sample1 or Sample2 it will replace expression using \"replacement\" value otherwise \"block parameter\" value is considered. Replacement results with example data: \"abc\", \"efg\" Template for uniqueName Resulting uniqueName ${Sample1}_${Sample2}_suffix abc_efg_suffix prefix_${Sample1}_${Sample2}_suffix prefix_abc_efg_suffix prefix.${Sample1}.midfix.${Sample2}.suffix prefix.abc.midfix.efg.suffix Expression Description ${ModelName} Replaced with Simulink model name ${ModelName} is a predefined optional expression which will be processed during Container-Build to construct the unique name. Example: { \"selectors\": [ { \"parameter\": \"BlockType\", \"value\": \"SubSystem\" } ], \"uniqueName\": \"prefix_${ModelName}_suffix\" (1) } 1 If we consider ModelName as \"Hello\", the resulting unique name is prefix_Hello_suffix. nonVirtualBusRules assist to configure uniqueName for any type of Simulink buses based on \"busNameSelector\", \"busElementNameSelector\" and \"busNameReplacement\", \"busElementNameReplacement\" configurations. It is possible to provide list of nonVirtualBusRules [0…​n]. busNameSelector is a filter, applied on the bus name, provided by value or regex configuration. busElementNameSelector is a filter, applied on the bus element name (bus member), provided by value or regex configuration. If nonVirtualBusRule does not contain any selectors, then uniqueName will be created for all the buses. To construct an uniqueName from nonVirtualBusRules, all the defined selectors are to satisfied. busNameReplacement is applied on the bus name by using regex, replacement. busElementNameReplacement is applied on the bus element name by using regex, replacement. In the regex pattern, 2 fixed expressions are allowed - ${busName}, ${busElementName}. These expressions are updated before processing regex and replacement Example: \"busElementNameReplacement\": { \"regex\": \"${busName}_(.*)\", (1) \"replacement\": \"$1\" } 1 If we consider busName as \"Hello\", the regex is updated with Hello_(.*) There are four optional fixed expressions that can be used within uniqueName: ${busNameReplacement}, ${busElementNameReplacement}, ${busElementName}, and ${busName}. { \"busNameSelector\": { \"value\": \"signalBus\" }, \"busElementNameSelector\": { \"regex\": \"signal__(.*)\" }, \"busNameReplacement\": { \"regex\": \"prefix_(.*)_suffix\", \"replacement\": \"$1\" }, \"busElementNameReplacement\": { \"regex\": \"(.*)__(.*)\", \"replacement\": \"$1\" }, \"uniqueName\": \"${busNameReplacement}.${busElementNameReplacement}\" } Expression Description ${busName} Replaced with bus name ${busElementName} Replaced with bus member name ${busNameReplacement} Replacement provided in the non-virtual bus rule ${busElementNameReplacement} Replacement provided in the non-virtual bus rule EHANDBOOK Container-Build provides the option to add a configurable and invisible unique name to AUTOSAR ports and its interfaces in the interface function overview. This hidden unique name is then used for MCD features like INCA connectivity in EHANDBOOK NAVIGATOR. { \"AUTOSAR\": { \"includeSwcInstanceName\": true, \"includePortName\": true } } In the above JSON file, ‘includeSwcInstanceName’ parameter applies the instance name of the component to be included in the name of port and interface. 'includePortName' parameter applies the port name to be added in the name of the interface. For example, a component instance “component” containing a port \"port\" having an interface \"interface\" would have the name as in the below table according to the various combinations provide in JSON file. includeSwcInstanceName includePortName true false true component.port.interface component.interface false port.interface interface In the workspace of an ASCET-DEVELOPER project, block diagrams are organized by means of so-called packages. When the EHANDBOOK documentation is generated for such models, the content for certain Class Instance blocks should not be included in certain cases. Typical cases are: a Class Instance is of a library type Class where details are not required to understand the meaning of the block a Class Instance block contains details which are subject to know-how protection In the corresponding interactive model, such Class Instances should then be non-expandable such that no details are exposed, and subsequently the textual documentation for the sub blocks of that Class Instance block need to be excluded from documentation as well. Excluding packages also have s significant improvement on RAM consumption and generation time during the Container-Build. In order to achieve this, EHANDBOOK Container-Build offers an optional command line argument -ascetdeveloperexcludepackages. The CLI argument must point to the path of a configuration file in JSON format that contains the list of ASCET-DEVELOPER packages to exclude from document generation. { \"packages\":[ \"packageX\", \"packageA.packageB\" ] } See sample ExcludePackages.json in the sub folder .\\examples\\configuration of your EHB-CB installation directory. In case of nested packages, fully qualified name of the package separated by “.” (DOT) needs to be provided. At EHANDBOOK, it is possible to establish communication between components across domains like AUTOSAR and MSR. To visualize these connectors in the function overview of the NAVIGATOR, a mapping file is processed during the container generation. To generate an EHANDBOOK Container which connects components from different domain, you have to pass the following arguments to eHandbookCB.exe -i specifies the sources that shall be converted. -o specifies where the EHANDBOOK Container shall be generated to -n name for the EHANDBOOK Container file that will be generated -componentconnectormappingfile \"\" specifies the path of the mapping file Sample Command C:\\ETAS\\EHANDBOOK-Container-Build_10.0.0-Windows\\eHandbookCB.exe ^ -i \"\" ^ -o \"\" ^ -n \"\"^ -componentconnectormappingfile \"\" The mapping file is passed via command line argument \"-componentconnectormappingfile\". The mapping file is expressed in .json or .csv format and contains details of connecting signals between functions of different domains. The following listing shows an example for the syntax of the JSON mapping file. You can download the file from here. [ { \"exported\": { \"port\": \"result\", \"component\": \"Function 1\" }, \"imported\": { \"port\": \"a\", \"component\": \"Function 2\" } } ] In the above JSON file, \"exported\" and \"imported\" parameter points to the port and component details. exportedPort: Name/Package path of the port which is exported from the source component. exportedComponent: Name/Package path of the exporting component. importedPort: Name/Package path of the port which is imported into the target component. importedComponent: Name/Package path of the importing component. The following listing shows an example for the syntax of the CSV mapping file. You can download the file from here. exportedPort exportedComponent importedPort importedComponent result Function 1 a Function 2 Using either of the above JSON or CSV specification, functions from different domains can be connected. ASCET-DEVELOPER apps are built from a set of static entry-point classes. To re-use algorithms, these can be specified as classes and instantiated where required. When classes contain instances of other classes, this creates so-called nested classes. Each class can be associated with some textual documentation in the form of an AsciiDoc file. Through this, the behavior of a class can be documented once. To obtain a full documentation for a static class with EHANDBOOK Container-Build, also the textual contents associated with all instantiated and nested classes can be considered. In order to achieve this, EHANDBOOK Container-Build offers an optional command line argument -ascetdevelopernestedclasses. Depending on the usage of nested classes, this option can lead to significant increase in EHANDBOOK generation time as each class instance gets documented at the place where it is used. In Simulink Addon, the content of the Simulink doc block is extracted from the model and added as documentation (AsciiDoc) for the respective subsystem along with its screen-shot. In the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR when clicked on the Simulink truth block, it opens a new tab with truth tables(Condition and Action tables) Figure 3. Truth tables rendered in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR Figure 4.

The container can be enriched by RTF-, AsciiDoc- and Excel-files to show more functionality in EHB-NAV. Define a directory structure with different names and sub hierarchies if required. Each sub directory name must be unique even it is in a separate branch or level! This structure is 1:1 used to generate the table of contents in NAV. Two TOCs will be created: SW architecture (like above) and flat alphabetical. EHB-CB is capable of generating Input directory structure from AUTOSAR files. A command line argument -ar2ehbcbinput is used for this purpose. In order to create such a directory structure, a path to the folder containing a root composition and corresponding ARXML file serves as input. For file details see also In AUTOSAR. Optionally, the root composition can be specified with the command line argument -autosarcomposition \"RootCompositionName\". EHB-CB will generate a directory structure in the given output path. For each composition in the corresponding sub folder, an AsciiDoc file is also auto generated. It contains a component interface diagram. The folder structure is directly suitable as input for the standard Directory Based EHB-CB. Beforehand, it could also be enriched manually or scripted with additional files, e.g. models, attachments or further description files. Example: C:\\eHandbook\\CB_Windows\\eHandbookCB.exe -i \"c:\\user\\input\" -o \"c:\\user\\output\" -ar2ehbcbinput Place exact one model in the lowest sub-hierarchy of the directory structure. Model could be: Preprocessed ANSI c-code as *.c and *.h in ASCII text, saved in UTF-8 encoding format (multiple files allowed) C-Code models packed as *.zip also possible Simulink model as *.mdl or *.slx with MATLAB version R2016b - R2022b Simulink models packed all together as one .zip wherein zip name is exactly same as main model name (.slx or *.mdl) also possible (see also Name Matching for zipped Simulink Main Files) ASCET model as *.axl out of ASCET V5.2.1 – V6.4.3 C code source files must be saved in UTF-8 encoding format. ANSI, other Unicode formats and Big-Endian formats are not supported. To allow the search proposal dialog, function overview, and label pop-up feature in EHB-NAV, labels have to be identified by the tool. To get to know, what are variables and parameters, and how a model component is interfacing to other components an internal data dictionary is used. As input format for EHB-CB *.xls is used here. The xls-files are placed in their respective function named folder, together with the model file. Per function, only one xls-file is allowed. Processing of this file provides the metadata dictionary. For further details and restrictions of XLS converter, please refer to the XLS Format Specification for EHB-CB document, which is located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. AUTOSAR Classic xml ( *.arxml) files are processed to fetch information about the AUTOSAR packages like compositions, components, ports and interfaces. These files can be placed in component named folders, together with the model file. Multiple arxml files can be placed inside a folder. Among the compositions in the arxml the user can provide the root composition by using the command line argument -autosarcomposition. Otherwise the root composition is calculated by CB. Supported Types Supported Elements out of this Type Interfaces SenderReceiverInterface, ParameterInterface Components CompositionSwComponentType, AtomicSwComponentType, ParameterSwComponentType, AdaptiveApplicationSwComponentType Connections AssemblySwConnector, DelegationSwConnector Datatypes ApplicationRecordDataType, ImplementationDataType, ApplicationArrayDataType A separate electronic license (EHB_CB_CON_AUTOSAR_CLASSIC) is required for this feature EHANDBOOK 9.2.1 does not support AUTOSAR application software which makes use of multiple instantiation concept. In case when a software component is instantiated multiple times, duplicate information can be shown in the label pop-up for ports. EHBANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 9.2.1 does not show AUTOSAR compositions as nested components. Furthermore, connections between ports of compositions are not shown. The file extension of ASAM MCD-2 MC compliant description files is \"A2L\", which is an abbreviation of \"ASAM MCD-2 MC Language\". The internal format of A2L-files is based upon a non-XML notation. Refer https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-2-mc/wiki/#TechnicalContent for specification details. These files can be included globally in the input folder or in a sub-directory, along with the model file in directory-based EHB-CB. Multiple A2L files can be placed inside a folder. Processing of these A2L files provide the metadata dictionary. The A2L-converter for the directory-based EHB-CB toolchain generates model interface data out of A2L files and aggregates them into the metadata database inside the container. This will allow enhanced EHB-NAV features like Label Tagging, Label-Popup, Search Proposals, Function Overview, Importing/Exporting Functions. Single or multiple A2L files(s) per functional component or globally in the input folder can be placed. Example of A2L files placed globally in input folder . └── input/ ├── Actuators/ │ ├── Actuators.mdl │ └── documentation.adoc ├── Tqs/ │ ├── Tqs.mdl │ └── documentation.adoc └── EHANDBOOK_FlexECU_Demo.a2l Example of A2L file in component-named folders . └── input/ ├── Actuators/ │ ├── Actuators.mdl │ ├── documentation.adoc │ └── EHANDBOOK_FlexECU_Demo.a2l └── Tqs/ ├── Tqs.mdl ├── documentation.adoc └── EHANDBOOK_FlexECU_Demo.a2l Information for model interfaces and labels (meta-data) can be read from multiple source formats in parallel. The files are to be placed in their respective function named folder (Directory based EHB-CB) or referenced in CCX (ASAM based EHB-CB, see in the document ASAM Format Specification for EHB, which is located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder). AUTOSAR information will be treated as base source with other sources complimenting the AUTOSAR meta-data. Product Supported Meta-data sources ASAM MDX,ARXML Directory ARXML,XLS Per sub directory, (normally this corresponds to a function component) you can add textual documents in RTF- or AsciiDoc format, together with the model file. This content is then transformed into the EHB container. Later it is shown in the function documentation window of the function component in EHB-NAV and describes verbally the functionality of the corresponding model. These documents can contain also images and screenshots of model hierarchies. You can add multiple documents per folder, even in both formats in parallel. EHB-CB supports a limited set of the styling and format possibilities of RTF only. For further details, e.g. chapter identification, linking of images and restrictions of RTF converter please refer to the RTF Format Specification for EHB-CB document, which is located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. EHB-CB provides some key words, which can be used to in-line additional graphical and textual information additionally to the RTF content into the text pane in EHB-NAV later. Link a given image to an interactive model hierarchy: [model] ASCET/Simulink models: Model hierarchy path in text style of type “Caption” Place a model screenshot, generated out of the interactive model and link to it: [ehbmodelref] ASCET/Simulink models: Model hierarchy path in text style of type “Caption” Simulink library models: Model hierarchy path from the referenced model in text style of type “Caption” C-code: filename.c/SubFunctionName in text style of type “Caption” Integrates the text out of an additional file: [ehbinline] filename Only the very most top sub functions of the c-file can be defined and selected for the graphic All elements of the model are shown in unexpanded view The c-file is in the same location as the RTF file Depending on the code size, the image of the interactive model may be too big to be shown fully in the text pane or be in reduced downsized view to fit in.

[ehbfunctionoverview-end] Integrates a Function Overview Diagram for all functions: [ehbfunctionoverview-all] Textual content can also be provided via AsciiDoc (https://asciidoc.org). Currently the following basic set of AsciiDoc attributes is supported: Paragraphs Text formatting Lists (ordered list, unordered list without nesting) Simple Tables Embed Graphics Source Code (Literal, Inline, Code block, Include are supported) Links to URL or files EHB-CB provides predefined key words, which can be used as macros to in-line additional model screenshots in the text pane and link them to an interactive model of function overview. A detailed description of all supported AsciiDoc attributes can be found in the AsciiDoc specification for EHB document, which is located in the sub folder ../documentation of your EHB-CB installation folder. An attachment is an additional file that is associated with content of an EHANDBOOK Container. Attachments are stored in EHANDBOOK Container files and shipped with them. Users of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR can open attachments to obtain additional information or data. When adopting EHANDBOOK, it is sometimes too hard to convert existing textual documentation contents (e.g. PDF or Word documents) to an EHANDBOOK input format (e.g. FSX or AsciiDoc). Instead of spending efforts on converting such contents, these can be added as attachments to a function documentation. Furthermore, there are various use cases where users of ECU software documentation can benefit from additional data or information, e.g. initial calibration data or automation scripts. However, this information is available in file formats that cannot be read with EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR or where it even does not make sense to view or read them in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR directly. On the other hand, it would be good for users to have all the information and data for an ECU function at a single place. Adding additional textual documentation as attachment to an EHANDBOOK Container saves time and effort to convert existing textual contents to an input format supported by EHANDBOOK. Rather than spending efforts, the contents can be directly added to the EHANDBOOK Container \"as-is\". Secondly, it is possible to enrich the EHANDBOOK Container with additional file-based information. Attachments can be distinguished into Documentation Contents and Complementary Information & Data. Documentation contents are contents which can be captured as documentation text in EHANDBOOK if the contents were provided by one of the supported input data formats (e.g., FSX or AsciiDoc). Documentation contents which are converted to EHANDBOOK internal format are shown in the built-in browser in a content tab. Complementary Information & Data are additional files which are typically not used directly in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The EHANDBOOK Container file acts as a structured and organized way to ship the information and data to users. The following table provides a list of examples. Documentation Contents Complementary information & data Textual documentation of ECU functions (e.g., function description) ECU software program files (.a2l and .hex/.s19) Calibration data files with initial or neutral calibration data (.dcm, .cdfx) Automation scripts (e.g., INCA Flow scripts, Matlab scripts, etc.) Additional training documents (e.g., calibration guides) (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel) Attachments are files associated to a documentation unit in particular a chapter in EHANDBOOK. This can be a general text chapter, a function description or a software component description. Depending on the EHANDBOOK Container-Build approach, this can be achieved in the following ways. In the directory-based EHB-CB approach, all files which shall be added as attachments must be stored in a sub-directory named _attachments. During EHANDBOOK Container-Build, the files are picked up and added as attachments.

For each documentation chapter which has additional attachments, an entry Attachments is added. This entry contains the attached files as a list. The name of the entry corresponds to the file name of the attachment as provided to EHANDBOOK Container-Build. The icon of the attachment entry is provided by your operating system. You can open an attachment by left-clicking on the corresponding entry with the mouse, right-clicking on the entry and selecting Open attachment from the context menu or hitting the key when the entry is selected You can save an attachment by right-clicking on the entry and selecting Save attachment from the context menu. Duplicate files are not supported by attachments. For example, if you specify two ABLOCKS with category ATTACHMENTS and associate both ABLOCKS with the same function component, then any duplicate attachments will be ignored (see log file). Attachments cannot be deleted from an EHANDBOOK Container. To make use of attachments, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 10.0 or newer is required. It is not (yet) possible for users of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to add attachments. NOTICE Incomplete container content due to wrong or corrupt file formats Content of the generated EHANDBOOK Container may be incomplete, if the input data used for generating the container are not compliant to the following file formats: ASAM formats CCX FSX MDX Image formats JPG PNG EPS Formulas TeX Text formats AsciiDoc (supported subset) These container contents can not be displayed in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Therefore, always check the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build, after generating a new container. Missing, incorrect or false content will be tracked in the log file. After generating a new container: Check the entries in the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container Build indicating missing or incorrect container content. Ensure that the data used during the import match the above specified formats. Generate a new container. Only provide containers for further usage in the EHANDBOOK- NAVIGATOR, if the log file contains no entries indicating any missing or incorrect content. If it is not possible to completely clean up the log file, inform the intended user of the container about this missing, incorrect or false container content. NOTICE Incomplete container content due to defective or inconsistent input data Content of the generated EHANDBOOK Container may be missing, if the input data used for generating the container is defective or inconsistent. Affected container contents cannot be displayed or will be displayed incorrectly in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Therefore, always check the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build. Defective or inconsistent input data that have led to errors when converting will be tracked in the log file. The content consistency is in the responsibility of the data supplier (documentation publisher). We recommend that the data supplier develop a standard procedure for pre-processing the input data outside the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool chain to ensure the data consistency and to reduce the workload for reviewing the input data. In addition, the pre-processing should be properly documented to ensure transparency. After generating a new container: Check the entries in the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build indicating defective or inconsistent input data. If necessary, fix the incorrect or inconsistent input data. Re-build the EHANDBOOK Container. Only provide containers for further usage in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, if the log file contains no entries, indicating any defective or inconsistent input data.","title":"Preparation Steps for Directory Based EHB-CB","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_User_Guide__Preparation_Steps_Dir_based_EHB_CB","url":"/ehandbook/how-to-guides/EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_User_Guide__Preparation_Steps_Dir_based_EHB_CB.html","titles":[{"text":"Input Directory Structure","hash":"_input_directory_structure","id":1},{"text":"Generation of Input Directory Structure from AUTOSAR files","hash":"arxml-to-EHB-CB-input-directory","id":2},{"text":"Models","hash":"_models","id":3},{"text":"Model Interface & Data Description","hash":"_model_interface_data_description","id":4},{"text":"In XLS","hash":"_in_xls","id":5},{"text":"In AUTOSAR","hash":"model-interface-data-description-in-Autosar","id":6},{"text":"In A2L","hash":"_in_a2l","id":7},{"text":"File Location and Usage","hash":"_file_location_and_usage","id":8},{"text":"Support for meta-data from multiple sources","hash":"_support_for_meta_data_from_multiple_sources","id":9},{"text":"Textual Content","hash":"_textual_content","id":10},{"text":"In RTF","hash":"_in_rtf","id":11},{"text":"Predefined Key Words in RTF","hash":"_predefined_key_words_in_rtf","id":12},{"text":"In AsciiDoc","hash":"_in_asciidoc","id":13},{"text":"Attachments","hash":"attachments-in-EHANDBOOK","id":14},{"text":"Addressed problems","hash":"_addressed_problems","id":15},{"text":"Benefits","hash":"_benefits","id":16},{"text":"Examples for attachments","hash":"_examples_for_attachments","id":17},{"text":"How to provide attachments to EHB-CB","hash":"_how_to_provide_attachments_to_ehb_cb","id":18},{"text":"Dir-based EHB-CB","hash":"_dir_based_ehb_cb","id":19},{"text":"ASAM-based EHB-CB","hash":"_asam_based_ehb_cb","id":20},{"text":"Attachments in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_attachments_in_ehandbook_navigator","id":21},{"text":"Opening an attachment","hash":"_opening_an_attachment","id":22},{"text":"Saving an attachment","hash":"_saving_an_attachment","id":23},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":24},{"text":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build","hash":"_ehandbook_container_build","id":25},{"text":"EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_ehandbook_navigator","id":26},{"text":"Important Notices","hash":"_important_notices","id":27}]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"…​","title":"","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"getting-started-dir-based-ehbcb","url":"/ehandbook/how-to-guides/getting-started-dir-based-ehbcb.html","titles":[{"text":"How to get started with Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build","hash":"_how_to_get_started_with_directory_based_ehandbook_container_build","id":1}]},"31":{"id":31,"text":"Simulink Passing Simulink library paths to EHB-CB Simulink DocBlocks in the documentation Simulink Variant block configuration support Simulink Truthtable block in the documentation ASCET-DEVELOPER Excluding Packages for ASCET-DEVELOPER Include Documentation for Nested Classed in ASCET-DEVELOPER C-Code C-Code Configuration Visual Appearance & Level of Detail Root-Level Skipping Model Depth Intermediate Hierarchy Filtering View Concept Configure appearance of Simulink library blocks Simulink View Concept Configuration of details shown for Simulink subsystem-based blocks Label-specific configurations Label Configuration Label Amendment Label configuration for AUTOSAR (Classic) interface elements","title":"","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"how-to-customize-interactive-models","url":"/ehandbook/how-to-guides/how-to-customize-interactive-models.html","titles":[]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"This how-to guide applies to the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build approach.

The approach described in this how-to guide for Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build approach can also be applied when generating EHANDBOOK Containers for ASCET-DEVELOPER apps. Each EHANDBOOK Container comes with one or multiple tables of contents. A table of contents provides a high-level navigation structure for the textual contents of an EHANDBOOK Container. In EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, the contents of a table of contents is shown in the Document Explorer. EHANDBOOK supports to specify multiple tables of contents such that different users of the ECU software documentation can use different navigation structures. In EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, users can switch between the provided tables of contents. Through this, they can choose a navigation structure depending on their use case or personal preference. Figure 1.

Select a table of contents to be shown The directory-based EHANDBOOK Conainer-Build tool-chain has a built-in feature to automatically derive two standard tables of contents: Alphabetically list of functions: This is a flat list of ECU functions or software components in alphabetic order Software architecture view: This is a hierarchical structure that mimics the ECU software architecture as specified by the directory structure Benefits are: No effort to specify a table of contents at all Standard tables of contents are created automatically Starting with EHANDBOOK 10.2, it is possible to specify the tables of contents explicitly. Through this, the automatically generated tables of contents can be replaced with customized ones. The format of the configuration file is YAML. To specify the structure of the tables of contents, a configuration file with the name tocs.yaml has to be provided in the root directory that is passed to EHANDBOOK Container-Build. └── 📒 ECU_SW_XYZ (1) └── 📒 SWC_1 ├── 📒 SWC_2 . . . ├── 📒 SWC_n ├── 📒 Composition_1 ├── 📒 Composition_2 └── 📄 tocs.yaml (2) 1 Root input directory to be passed to EHANDBOOK Container-Build 2 File with explicit specification of tables of contents For ASCET-DEVELOPER, the tocs.yaml file must be placed in the same directory as the .app file for which an EHANDBOOK Container shall be generated.

While the rendering of several types of blocks is supported natively by EHANBOOK-NAVIGATOR, in order to achieve best results for complex blocks as well as blocks from libraries, it is necessary to pass all necessary information and some additional configuration for how to interpret the libraries to EHANDBOOK Container-Build. In this how-to guide, you will learn the relevant backgrounds for how Simulink models are constructed, and what information EHANDBOOK Container-Build requires to achieve best results in EHANDBOOK. To better explain and understand the concepts, we’ll use an example Simulink model. The sources for the example can be downloaded. Download example The main Simulink model is contained in the file Function.slx. The model contains references to two other Simulink models, Addition and Multiplication. Furthermore, there is a subsystem that contains some example blocks from Simulink libary. Figure 1. Graphical representation of Function.slx in Simulink Figure 2. Graphical representation of subsystem Example blocks from Simulink library The result we want to achieve in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR looks as follows: The contents of the referenced models are resolved and inlined into the interactive model in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The blocks drawn from the library are rendered with the same graphics as in Simulink. In case of library blocks that are specified as subsystems, no further inner details are shown in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR (i.e., no possibility to navigate in or expand the block). Figure 3. Interactive model for Function.slx in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in same, default layout as in Simulink Figure 4. Interactive model for Function.slx in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR with expanded subsystems A Simulink model is saved as an .slx file. A Simulink model consists of blocks with ports and connections. The model can be hierarchical. For the latter, so-called sub-systems are used. Simulink provides two main mechanisms to build models based on re-usable artifacts. Simulink libraries Referenced models The following figure shows the conceptual differences between blocks from libraries (e.g., the standard Simuliunk block library) and referenced models. Figure 5. Difference between referenced blocks from libraries and referenced models \"A block library is a collection of blocks that you can use in a Simulink® model. You can create instances of blocks from built-in Simulink libraries, and you can make custom libraries for instances of blocks that you create.\" — Custom Libraries: Reusable libraries of blocks and subsystems https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/libraries.html Simulink libraries can be accessed through the Simulink Library browser. The Simulink library browser provides an overview on all installed Simulink libraries as well as quick access to the specified blocks and subsystems. To instantiate a block from a Simulink library, the block has to be dragged & dropped into a Simulink model. EHANDBOOK supports rendering of blocks that originate from libraries. For this to work properly, the following three configurations must be provided to EHANDBOOK Container-Build: The Simulink library files (typically .slx files) that contain the specification of the library blocks must be passed to EHANDBOOK Container-Build (or the Unified Graphics Generator). This is achieved by provided one or multiple paths to the location of the required libraries via the command-line option -simlib or -simlibfile. For further details, see Simulink library paths support. To render the graphics of the block appropriately, a connection to MATLAB is required (i.e., the option -nomatlab must not be used). For library blocks, it is often sufficient to show the block with its inputs, outputs and graphical rendition - but not with its inner details. In cases where library blocks are specified as subsystems, the inner details can be hidden. This is achieved specifiying a view configuration where inner details of referenced blocks are hidden. Simulink library files can typically found in the MATLAB installation path where the specific toolbox that provides the library is installed. For example, for the standard Simulink library, this can typically be found under C:\\Program Files\\MATLAB\\R2021a\\toolbox\\simulink\\blocks\\library\\simulink.slx The path is different for the specific MATLAB release. A model reference is a reference to another model using a Model block. These references create model hierarchy. Each referenced model has a defined interface that specifies the properties of its inputs and outputs. The defined interface makes the behavior of the referenced model independent of its context in the model hierarchy. (…​) Model references are ideal for code reuse, unit testing, parallel builds, and large components. They can also reduce file contention and merge issues. — Model References: Reuse models as blocks in other models https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/model-reference.html EHANDBOOK supports resolving and including referenced models. For this to work properly, the referenced models have to be provided along with the main model file to EHANDBOOK Container-Build. To form an unambiguous unit, referenced model files must be zipped together with the main model file into a ZIP archive file. The ZIP archive file must have the same name as the main model file. Figure 6. Example Simulink model with referenced models in a ZIP file (as expected by EHANDBOOK Container-Build) Simulink provides the possibility to create new, custom blocks and add them to the Simulink library browser (see Block Authoring and Simulation Integration). There are various types of blocks based on which a custom block can be specified (e.g., based on an S-Function). One possibility is to specify the behavior of a custom block by means of a Simulink block diagram. In this case, the custom block to be used is a subsystem. Per default, you can navigate subsystems or expand them in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Figure 7. Example interactive model with library blocks For blocks that originate from a library, it is possible to hide the inner contents. This has various benefits: The Simulink-based interactive model is less complex (i.e., fewer model hierarchies) The know-how for how library blocks are specified is not exposed (know-how protection) In order to hide the contents of library blocks, a view configuration has to be specified and passed to EHANDBOOK Container-Build via command-line options. { \"GlobalView\": { (1) \"HideContents\": [ (2) { \"BlockType\": \"Reference\" (3) } ] } } 1 Name of the view 2 Specification of what view type to apply 3 Criterion that view shall be applied to blocks of type reference To pass the view configuration to EHANDBOOK Container-Build, the following CLI options have to be passed. -simulinkview \".\\configuration\\SimulinkViewConfig.json\" ^ (1) -viewtype \"GlobalView\" ^ (2) 1 Provide path to Simulink view configuration file 2 Provide name for the Simulink view that shall be applied Figure 8.

There are three so-called views defined, named EXTERNAL, INTERNAL and DETAILED. For each view, the function or software developer can define the visual appearance of Simulink blocks and subsystems. The main purpose of the View add-on is to protect the intellectual property (IP) of the Simulink model. The following views can be applied on Simulink elements: As Line: Blocks with one input and one output are shown as a single line. Hide Contents: Subsystems can not be opened. Inner details are hidden. Invisible: Annotations / unconnected blocks are not shown. If this customized Simulink View add-on is installed an additional menu entry is available: Figure 1. Simulink View add-on In the context menu, for each and every Simulink block its visual appearance can be configured for each view: Figure 2. View Configuration When some of these methods are used for e.g. external view, not all details of the model are shown anymore. This functionality is not part of the standard Mathworks product. Mathworks will provide this feature on demand. In ETAS ASCET 6, this functionality is part of the standard product. The Simulink View add-on creates a new sub folder below the model file. The folder has the name of the Simulink model appended with the suffix _VCFDB. For each element of the model, the sub folder contains an XML-file which defines the visual appearance of it for every view. The name of the file must be modelName_COL_.XML. Figure 3. Naming convention for directory structure An XML-file is only required for blocks where a view should be applied. The XML structure must follow this schema: Figure 4. View configuration for a block in XML The number in the above in the XML is the ID which are defined as SIDs in the blockdiagram.XML file for every Simulink block. This file is part of the zipped Simulink model .slx file. In newer MATLAB versions, the SIDs are located in the systems\\system_x.XML inside the zipped .slx file. Figure 5. Simulink ID number in XML inside the zipped .slx file You can use this view concept also without the Simulink View add-on. In this case, you have to create the files by your own manually or by a script: Identify the SID of the block, for which a view should be applied Create an XML-file with the view configuration for it according to the sample above Store this file with the name modelName_COL_.XML in the sub folder modelName_VCFDB of your .slx model file. Besides for ASCET models, the Directory-based EHB-CB and UGG are supporting this Simulink view concept in addition. The ASAM based EHB-CB is supporting the Simulink view concept on special request only. To define the view for the container, the entry EXTERNAL in the CCX file must be used. This entry has then priority to the command line parameter -viewtype . The following steps are required that EHB takes care of the defined views in a Simulink model: Make sure, that the sub folder ModelName_VCFDB with the corresponding XML-files is available below the file ModelName.slx Start EHB-CB / UGG with the additional command line parameter -viewtype \"EXTERNAL\", \"INTERNAL\" or \"DETAILED\" During model conversion, EHB-CB interprets the XML-files and creates model screenshots and interactive models for this particular view provided by the command line. The provided view type is applied to all Simulink models of the container. All hidden elements are deleted from the interactive model before it is taken into the EHANDBOOK container. If a model hierarchy is described with text and model screenshot in DETAILED view, but in EXTERNAL view, this model content is marked as hidden no screenshot will be created and a broken image sign is shown in EHANDBOOK instead for the external view container. Therefore, you have to ensure, that for external documentation, also this text and screenshot part is removed from the input AsciiDoc file. If \"Hide contents\" is applied for a block, signal highlighting over blocks is not possible in EHANDBOOK NAVIGATOR because the inner details are not known.

When you are working with a multiple EHANDBOOK files, it is difficult to identify the information or documentation contents which are displayed in the Document viewer originated from. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR offers a solution by giving the variant colored flags and the alias names to each container. The usage of colored flags and the alias names in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR are stated below: Displays alias names as well as the assigned color flag for different EHANDBOOK file in the table of contents (TOC). The functions of all the file are aggregated together in the \"All Functions\" in the Document Explorer. The tabs of the Document Viewer and Model Viewer display their assigned color flag and alias names as well. Search proposals show colored flags and alias names to indicate the source of the displayed information. In the search results view, a column EHANDBOOK displays all the EHANDBOOK files where your search results are located. You can use the filter to minimize your search results and search the results only in the required EHANDBOOK file(s). The blocks representing function in function overview diagrams are colored with the assigned color flag for its background and named with its alias name at the bottom. NOTICE The graphical model presentation might differ from the real ECU functionality. The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR then may contain erroneous elements and missing user comments in an interactive model when displaying automatic layouts! Therefore, always compare the content of the interactive model in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR with the real ECUs function by validating that the graphical model presentation corresponds to the ECU documentation source before you start working. To identify the cause for the wrong, missing or incomplete content, the producer of the container must check the source files from where the container was created. If the source files are correct and the appearance of the error is reproducible, the producer of the container must contact the local sales representative or the ETAS support to report this error. NOTICE The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR may display erroneous connections between functions, that do not corresponds to the real ECU software. The functions' interface descriptions of one ore more EHANDBOOK containers (e. g. function overviews, labels, pop-ups) may not correspond to the real ECU software. Therefore, always check the conformity of the functions' interface descriptions. This feature helps to extract contents from the currently loaded EHANDBOOK container and generate a new EHANDBOOK container by selecting only the required functions from the existing container. EHANDBOOK container (.ehb) and encrypted EHANDBOOK container (.ehbcrypt) files are supported.

There are certain limitations in the rendering of the following stylings: Right alignment of text Table appearance Hidden text due to overlapping whitespaces Provide output directory name and path (-o option) case sensitive that is in sync with OS. If case insensitive, PDF generation fails. This section describes the set of known problems of the released version of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 12.1. We identified an issue in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR version 12.1.0 that affects containers or projects containing comments without content (EHANDBOOK containers). This issue can cause EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR’s change detection functionality to malfunction, rendering it unusable for these containers/projects. In such scenarios, neither continuing to use nor terminating EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is possible. This issue was introduced in version 12.1.0 and has been resolved in the subsequent release, version 12.1.1. In ASCET V6 based interactive models, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR does not show \"Start\" and \"History\" states for state machines. When \"Invisible view\" info is applied to a state, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR does not show the transition attached to the state. Formulas text is not selectable/searchable. Combination of styled and normal text are not searchable in Local Search. Example: Search strings containing bold and normal text does not yield search results. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR will hang if connection to INCA is not cleared properly. In such a case, follow the procedure for disconnecting from INCA as indicated in the User Guide document. When EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is connected to INCA prior to version 7.2 SP8 and a map is modified in the experiment, the values are not updated and old values are shown. Alternatively, SP 9 onwards resolves the issue. Highlighting of connected elements for larger number of ports requires more RAM and time. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR shows a different icon for group tables in comparison to ASCET. Interaction with topics having large textual content might take more time (eg. ’Find in Current Tab’). Variable icon is shown in label popup for \"Service\" type labels . Signal flow highlighting is not propagated properly for \"Self Class\" block in collapsed state. Trigger signal flow highlighting with \"Self Class\" block in expanded state. When using Find in EHANDBOOK File(s) with term containing punctuation characters, scrolling and highlighting of search hit is not done. Ex: (Ex: Opm.3) Use local search post topic opening or open search hits found for parameter/variable type. When label amendment for hierarchies is performed, the following issue may occur: Ex: Open interactive model might not get directed to the appropriate level in interactive model in some cases. Annotated values and labels on interactive models could be overlayed by blocks in default layout. Alternatively, switch to auto layout. Rendering for some interactive blocks across different versions of Simulink might have a different representation. (Ex: The EHANDBOOK Container is generated using different versions of MATLAB). Setting windows system scaling factor to greater than 100% might result in blurry text and images in textual documentation. Alternatively, switch windows system scaling factor to 100% for all monitors. When a text occurs multiple times in the same state model, Find in EHANDBOOK File(s) highlights all of them in a search hit. Sometimes Navigate in action does not bring blocks to the focus area. Alternatively, click Fit to View from the status toolbar to bring them to focus. Usage of unsupported Simulink toolboxes might result in corrupted interactive models. Usage of web fonts in EHANDBOOK container configured via commonltr.css file is not supported for EHANDBOOK Containers generated using versions older than 8.3. In Simulink, Inport blocks can be duplicated to so-called InportShadow blocks. InportShadow blocks are not yet fully supported in EHANDBOOK. For example, the inner label (typically a number) is missing. Furthermore, no virtual connections are established, and highlighting dependencies is not supported. When adjusting the size or switching editors in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, viewers can temporarily go black. When EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is connected to INCA for live measurement, there could be a significant performance degradation leading to unresponsive UI. In an ASCET-DEVELOPER based interactive model, the State behavior text could overflow from the State block. Alternatively switch to auto layout. A screenshot based on ASCET-DEVELOPER state machine could get clipped if transitions of the state machine extend outside the state or region. Auto-correction of duplicate groups, functions, measurements, and characteristics for A2L files with include statements is not supported. Simulink models having Pixel Icon Units may not be rendered properly. Dangling virtual connections might be visible in the interactive model in case of a minimized application window. Alternatively, performing some navigation or re-layouting operations would fix the interactive model. Visualization of Map graph in Label pop-ups might not work on a Windows 11-Virtual machine environment. Self-loop connections in interactive models may sometimes overlap on other parts of the model. For attachments, some icons in the Document Explorer might have a black background. Expand icons in interactive models may not be clickable in default layout when other blocks/labels overlap. Alternatively, blocks can be expanded using the context menu. Model Explorer and Model Navigation Bar may show entries without labels when blocks do not have a name in the source model. Focus may sometimes toggle between the label popup window and the main EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR window. Alternatively, click on some part of the main EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR window. When opening multiple model editors showing very large models EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR could stop working properly due to memory consumption. Closing tabs can restore the application. Subsystems which only contain static documentation text might be displayed wrongly. In case the subsystem appears empty switch from auto layout to default layout. Open model link might open the wrong location in case there are multiple blocks with the same name. In case of Duplicate functions in the container, Bookmarking model will always open first function in the container and also bookmarks all function with same URI.","title":"Known Issues","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"known_issues","url":"/ehandbook/known-issues/known_issues.html","titles":[{"text":"Container-Build","hash":"_container_build","id":1},{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":2},{"text":"Issues with model path containing special characters","hash":"_issues_with_model_path_containing_special_characters","id":3},{"text":"MATLAB Simulink","hash":"_matlab_simulink","id":4},{"text":"Simulink blocks with \"Show Block Name\" option set to \"Auto\" are always shown","hash":"_simulink_blocks_with_show_block_name_option_set_to_auto_are_always_shown","id":5},{"text":"Display issues with Simulink Annotation blocks","hash":"_display_issues_with_simulink_annotation_blocks","id":6},{"text":"PDF","hash":"_pdf","id":7},{"text":"PDF generation failure","hash":"_pdf_generation_failure","id":8},{"text":"Navigator","hash":"_navigator","id":9}]},"44":{"id":44,"text":"EHB EHANDBOOK in general / EHANDBOOK solution EHB-CB EHANDBOOK Container-Build EHB-NAV EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR UGG Unified Graphics Generator TOC Table of contents FC Function Component SWC Software Component","title":"Definitions and Abbreviations","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"02_definitions_and_abbreviations","url":"/ehandbook/references/02_definitions_and_abbreviations.html","titles":[]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"This document describes the usage of EHANDBOOK Container-Build with ASAM EX files The new ETAS EHANDBOOK solution is an interactive documentation tool set, making ECU software understandable. This solution consists in 3 parts: the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool chain for the container generation, later called EHB-CB, the container itself, which is containing the documentation data in a special format and the EHANDBOOK NAVIGATOR, the tool to work with the containers, later called EHB-NAV. One possibility as input for EHB-CB are files in ASAM exchange format. This document describes the required structure of the ASAM files for EHB related use cases only. For the general format and structure information of ASAM Exchange, please refer to www.asam.net. Here you can get the full specifications for - ASAM CC (Container Catalog) is used for describing engineering objects: Definition of an XML-based format for describing engineering objects such as source code, compiled objects or documentation files, and associated meta information about the objects, such as creator, name or version. Primarily used for exchanging information between OEM and supplier. ASAM FSX (Functional Specification Exchange Format) describes the functional behavior of software: Definition of an XML-based format for describing the functional specification of software, primarily for the purpose of generating technical documentation. The format allows documentation via prose text in multiple languages, cross-referencing, linking and mentioning of requirements. Variations of the specification can be expressed. Is complementary to MDX, which contains the interface definitions of functions. FSX is a subset of MSRSW components ASAM MDX (Model Data Exchange Format) describes the software architecture and data definition of the software: Definition of an XML-based format for describing interfaces of functions, their data (variables and calibration parameters) and scheduling in ECU software. This allows the integration of such functions as object code into the overall ECU software without having access to the source code. Standard is complementary to FSX, which contains the functional description of functions. MDX is the predecessor of the AUTOSAR Software Component Template If you have your input files in a different format, we are happy to support you with our ETAS engineering services and adapt the EHB-CB to your needs. Here a brief overview about the ASAM concept in principle in the context of EHB: Figure 1. ASAM EX Overview in the EHB context NOTICE Incomplete container content due to wrong or corrupt file formats Content of the generated EHANDBOOK Container may be incomplete, if the input data used for generating the container are not compliant to the following file formats: ASAM formats CCX FSX MDX Image formats JPG PNG EPS Formulas TeX Text formats AsciiDoc (supported subset) These container contents can not be displayed in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Therefore, always check the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build, after generating a new container. Missing, incorrect or false content will be tracked in the log file. After generating a new container: Check the entries in the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container Build indicating missing or incorrect container content. Ensure that the data used during the import match the above specified formats. Generate a new container. Only provide containers for further usage in the EHANDBOOK- NAVIGATOR, if the log file contains no entries indicating any missing or incorrect content. If it is not possible to completely clean up the log file, inform the intended user of the container about this missing, incorrect or false container content. NOTICE Incomplete container content due to defective or inconsistent input data Content of the generated EHANDBOOK Container may be missing, if the input data used for generating the container is defective or inconsistent. Affected container contents cannot be displayed or will be displayed incorrectly in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Therefore, always check the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build. Defective or inconsistent input data that have led to errors when converting will be tracked in the log file. The content consistency is in the responsibility of the data supplier (documentation publisher). We recommend that the data supplier develop a standard procedure for pre-processing the input data outside the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool chain to ensure the data consistency and to reduce the workload for reviewing the input data. In addition, the pre-processing should be properly documented to ensure transparency. After generating a new container: Check the entries in the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build indicating defective or inconsistent input data. If necessary, fix the incorrect or inconsistent input data. Re-build the EHANDBOOK Container. Only provide containers for further usage in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, if the log file contains no entries, indicating any defective or inconsistent input data. In principle, there are 3 different type of files, CCX, MDX and FSX. Per project, there is exactly on CCX file and typically per function one MDX and FSX file. In the context of EHB, the CCX contains the table(s) of contents, all FCs with their references to FSX&MDX and the model locations. The FSX contains the text chapters with their texts and graphics and the MDX contains all label definitions and interfaces. Component naming conventions for EHANDBOOK: FC = function component, smallest software unit, which contains one Simulink or ASCET model BC = base component, which contains multiple FCs GC = group component, which contains multiple BCs BCs and GCs allowing to design a hierarchical structure of the components, which is later on seen in the table of contents in NAV. EHB-CB supports ASAM CC in V3.0.0, ASAM FSX in V1.1.0 and ASAM MDX in V1.3.0. in their corresponding DTD versions. The supported encoding file format is UTF-8. The keywords and objects of ASAM were read according to the standard, but interpreted to the needs of EHB. The support is limited to the use cases relevant to EHB and restricted to basic functionalities only. The CCX file structure for EHANDBOOK consists of a chain list of ABLOCKs, which refer other ABLOCKs using the AREF tag ID-REF value: . These ABLOCKs can be broadly classified and understood as Root ABLOCK, TOC ABLOCK, Components ABLOCKs (GC, BC, FC) and leaf ABLOCK (which is not having further reference to another ABLOCK) Figure 2. ABLOCK Referencing Mechanism for EHB in CCX The CCX file starts with the CATALOG entry and a root block: Sample Catalog entry and Root ABLOCK header in CCX ... The catalog entry has an AREF tag, which refers to the root ABLOCK. Root ABLOCK Referred from: block with Refers to: TOC ABLOCKs/Special ABLOCKs The Root ABLOCK provides info for the title page in EHB and refers the TOC ABLOCKS. Besides references to the TOCs, there are also some special general references to the following elements possible: Global MDX file (see chapter One global MDX File) Global CDF file (see chapter CDF ABLOCK Usage) ASCET Library (see chapter ASCET Model Reference to global Library and other Sub-Components) The root ABLOCK contains the information about the project creation date, language, short-name, long-name, variant, etc. inside SDG tag which are used to create the title page for the container.

For details, see chapter Simulink Model Reference to external Library. The title page, the general font styling, the company logo and the footer text are configurable in the separate CSS and branding.properties files. Please refer to the document Title Page Style Guide for EHB-CB. The different tables of content (TOCs), defined in separate ABLOCKS, are referenced also in the root ABLOCK.

There is also a global referring from the Root ABLOCK possible (TDATA-PRO). The relevant MDX file content is used for the model interface data and label information. To allow this, the of the FC ABLOCK must match to the SW-FEATURE in the MDX file. (Read more in chapter 4) == The MDX File Structure The MDX file contains information about variables, parameters, system constants and class instances. This meta data (like imported/exported/local, compu-method, data-type, …) of labels is stored in an internal database of the EHB container. In addition, the standard chapters Systemconstant-Parameter-Variable-Classinstance-Structure for each FC are created out of this data. The appearance of these standard chapters can be configured in a flexible way. All chapter-, header- and column-names or amount of columns can be specified. For details please refer to the chapter Label table configuration in the EHB-CB User Guide. Furthermore, the MDX content is used for properties view, label pop-up, auto-tagging and search proposal dialog in EHB-NAV. Another NAV feature supported using MDX information is the “Function Overview”. It provides mapping between the FC’s in the whole container and how all the element labels are related. This works name based. Example in EHB-NAV: The MDX format for EHB in detail: All variables, parameters and system constants have to be defined in the global , their meta data will be specified in the section . Sample MDX snippet for the global data dictionary Amf_facRelAir_Sim Long name Amf_facRelAir_Sim VALUE ... Iac_degIgnOptOffset Long name Iac_degIgnOptOffset VALUE ... All labels defined in the dictionary have to be unique by their . In addition, this name should match to the name in the a2l file to allow INCA life data visualization in NAV later on. Per SW component, the labels defined in the dictionary, are then referred by their as local, exported or imported. Sample MDX snippet for a FC with its label interfaces Iac_mdl Feature Iac FCT ... Iac_Ex_mdl EXPORT ... Iac_Im_mdl IMPORT ... ... EHANDBOOK supports configuration of structure data types for Simulink. Structures are mapped to Simulink buses and visualized in EHB-NAV in the label popup. Structures can be defined in MDX following the MDX specification. EHANDBOOK supports the following subset of MDX: STRUCTURE - SW-VARIABLE STRUCTURE - SW-CALPRM The structure name and member names must match to the Simulink bus names. Structures are defined in the global data dictionary in the same way as other variables or parameters, but in a hierarchical construct. Variable with CATEGORY “STRUCTURE” contains tag under which other variables are defined. This head SW-VARIABLE becomes the ‘structure’ and the children SW-VARIABLEs become members to it. Sample MDX snippet for a struct in the global data dictionary subBus subBus longName STRUCTURE VAR_INIT READ-ONLY chirp chirp Signal VALUE VAR_INIT READ-ONLY sine sine wave VALUE VAR_CLEARED READ-ONLY Naming convention and rules: In the above example SW-VARIABLE subBus becomes the ‘structure’ and SW-VARIABLE chirp and sine become its members. Internally in EHANDBOOK we store the members along with its structure name, for example “subBus.chirp” and “subBus.sine”. The delimiter ‘.’ dot is used for combining the structure and member names. SW-VARIABLE structure cannot contain another SW-VARIABLE structure inside it. Nesting of structures are not allowed as per the MDX specifications (see mdx_v1.3.0.xsd). The member names of a structure can repeat with different structures. It only needs to be unique within its structure. For example, structure1.sine and structure2.sine can exist. The referring between the structure and the FC component works also in the same way as other variables via their : Sample MDX snippet for a FC with referring a structure Iac_mdl Feature Iac FCT subBus SW-VARAIBLE of category STRUCTURE are referenced to a SW-FEATURE using the with “IMPORT”, “EXPORT” categories or (=local). From the above example subBus will be treated as local for the SW-FEATURE under which it is defined. EHANDBOOK does not derive the relation between the SW-FEATURE and the structure members. Users have to explicitly add an entry of a structure.member in the REFERENCES for establishing the import/export category. For example subBus.sine won’t appear as local in the EHANBDOOK context unless the user enters subBus.sine as a SW-VARIABLE-REF. In CCX, the FC ABLOCK is referring to its MDX file ABLOCK using AREF-ID. The reference from the FC ABLOCK in CCX to its related content in the MDX file is done by . The SW-FEATURE in MDX must be same as the FC in the CCX file. The result in EHB-NAV is the standard chapter “Systemconstant-Parameter-Variable-Classinstance-Structure “ with the corresponding table to appear, as shown below: Referencing method between CCX and individual MDX per FC FC ABLOCK Iac_mdl Ignition Angle Calculation Iac - Ignition Angle Calculation FC (1) 1 Reference to MDX ABLOCK MDX ABLOCK iac_mdx TDATA-S Iac_mdl\\_doc\\iac.mdx (1) 1 Reference to MDX File MDX File (1) Iac_mdl (2) Feature Iac FCT ... 1 See Visualisation in EHB-NAV 2 Short name matches with FC ABLOCK Figure 8.

Referencing method between CCX and individual MDX per FC Besides individual MDX files for each FC, there is also the possibility to use one common MDX file for all function components in the whole container. This global MDX file is defined in a separate ABLOCK in CCX in the same way as for the individual ones per FC, but linked in a different way: It has to be referenced with its ID as an additional TOC entry in the CCX in AREFS.

Here also the font and color of all the texts and headers can be defined. For more details, please refer to the Container Style Guide for EHB-CB document. Static graphics are explaining images inside the textual content, which have no links to a corresponding interactive model. To allow this, the information has to be given as follows: In CCX: The FC ABLOCK references the Graphic ABLOCK and the FSX ABLOCK via tags The Graphic ABLOCK contains the path and name of the graphic in In FSX: The FIGURE’s has to match with the of the Graphic ABLOCK in CCX See figure below: Reference flow diagram to show a static image FC ABLOCK Iac_mdl Ignition Angle Calculation Iac - Ignition Angle Calculation FC (1) (2) 1 Reference to FSX ABLOCK 2 Reference to Graphic ABLOCK Graphic ABLOCK Iac_graph1 PIC-D Iac_mdl\\_pic\\iac_asSVG.svg (1) 1 Reference to image file.

Visualisation in EHB-NAV Figure 15. Reference flow diagram to show a static image The external 3th party tool PDFFLY will be used for conversion of post script graphics (EPS, PS) to vector graphics (SVG). This tool has to be ordered separately. Raster graphics (JPEG, BMP, PNG) and vector graphics (SVG) are directly copied without the need of any 3rd party software. ETAS recommends the usage of graphics in SVG format to allow text searching and selecting inside the graphic later on in NAV. (Text in the SVG have to be configured within tag ) The graphic is extracted as a screenshot out of a specific hierarchy of a model (Simulink or ASCET) with a tool outside EHB. Therefore, a reference from the graphic to the model with some information about the path and sub-model hierarchy is required. A graphic with a model reference will appear in EHB-NAV as below: Figure 16. Sample view in EHB-NAV for a model screenshot using a separate image By click on “Open interactive Model”, the corresponding interactive model will be opened in EHB-NAV in exactly the same model hierarchy path. To allow this, the information has to be given as follows: In CCX: The FC ABLOCK references the Graphic ABLOCK, the Model ABLOCK and the FSX ABLOCK via tags The Graphic ABLOCK contains the reference ID of the Model ABLOCK in , the model hierarchy path in . For model path details see chapter Model Hierarchy Path Naming Convention for Graphic Linkage. The Model ABLOCK contains the directory path and file name of the model. This is an axl file having the ASCET project or an mdl/slx file for Simulink.

(See latest user documentation for EHB-CB) The linkage method between FSX and CCX is a little bit different then described before, also there some changes in the FSX: In FSX, the FIGURE’s for the model graphic contains the model hierarchy path directly in a mandatory format i.e. “X.Y.Z”. For details, see chapter Model Hierarchy Path Naming Convention for Graphic Linkage.

Compare the C-Code source code with the its graphical representation in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. For a proper linkage between the image and the corresponding model hierarchy, the model hierarchy path has to be named and used in a defined way. Using EHB-CB generated graphics: The model path name must be used as FSX FIGURE’s . Path delimiter is ‘.’ Using external graphics: The FSX FIGURE’s has to match the Graphic’s ABLOCK in CCX The Graphic’s ABLOCK must contain the model path name in LambdaControl/Main in the Graphic ABLOCK. For the SHORT-NAME’s it has to be transformed to LambdaControl.Main. The model path can be derived directly out of the Model Explorer in EHB-NAV: Figure 24. Sample view in EHB-NAV for Simulink model hierarchy path The bubble help window for the above highlighted path shows “Lcc/Lcc_mdl/Two-point-controller”. That is the exact name for the Lcc/Lcc_mdl/Two-point-controller in the Graphic ABLOCK. For the SHORT-NAME’s it has to be transformed to Lcc.Lcc_mdl.Two-point-controller.

Sample view in EHB-NAV for Function Overview It is possible to auto-generate a function overview graphic in the text pane of a FC in EHB-NAV. This overview image can be made out of one function or even out of multiple functions. Same as the interactive model screenshot also this overview graphic has a link via the “Open function overview” button to the corresponding interactive overview. To make this possible, for every Function Overview additional entries in CCX and FSX are required. In FSX: Add a entry with unique at the text position, where the graphic should appear. In CCX: Add a new ABLOCK entry in the CCX file. This ABLOCK contains the details of functions chosen for the Function Overview diagram. This ABLOCK must be referred by FC ABLOCK using the tag The properties of the ABLOCK must be set as follows: The of the ABLOCK should correspond to the FIGURE’s in FSX The must be “PIC-FO” The must be “function_overview” There must be an individual entry of SD GID=”component” for every function considered for the Function Overview diagram The function names provided here should match the SW-FEATURE’s of the component provided in the MDX file(s) The [function-overview-image] below shows how this works out for one function component. For multiple functions in the overview diagram, it works the same way. The only change is in the Function Overview ABLOCK, where now the additional functions are defined: Sample Function Overview ABLOCK with multiple functions XFN1 PIC-FO Iac_mdl Tqs_mdl T2t_mdl In the example above, three functions Icc_mdl, Tqs_mdl and T2t_mdl are considered for the overview graphic generation.

Compare the C-Code source code with the its graphical representation in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The standard behavior is that the ASCET axl file contains the ASCET project and all needed modules and classes. An extension in the future will support also external references to sub components and global libs in other directories. If ASCET models for any FC are referencing a global library with general classes or services, this also has to be defined in the CCX as follows: The prerequisites for this concept are: There exists exactly one main directory for the global libs (called services here) which may contain multiple subdirectories, defined in CCX as described above. There is no inter FC referencing used, but a sub-class could refer to another sub-class in the same FC. So references are only possible below the main directory of the FC or in the directory (or subdirectories) of the global libs There is exactly one root axl per FC, which contains the ASCET project and is referred in the CCX (name e.g. _p.axl) File names for classes in subdirectories of the FCs could be named the same, but all names in the global lib directory and below must be unique. Typically, a Simulink model is also referencing external models or libraries. EHB-CB is capable to handle this in multiple ways: Reference alongside The library or model is found if it is in the same directory level as the main model itself Reference by system variable Libraries were searched in system environment variable TB_HOMEDIR, sub path \\dgs_lib_mlsl and below. Reference defined in CCX One search path can be defined as tag in the Root ABLOCK in CCX: ehbContainer Detailed PVER ETAS FlexECU-G1 Turbo EHB_Demo_Container 2019-07-31 10:39:00 V7.1.1 3 EHANDBOOK Demo SWCALDOC DE true true false Software Documentation C:\\source\\Simulink\\M160 ... There is exactly one absolute file path allowed. Reference defined by parameter A search path can be defined by the command line parameter -simlib “path”. Here even multiple paths are allowed, separated by commas -simlib “path1,path2,etc” The order above also defines the search order for a library, but without a fallback mechanism. If a path is defined, but there is no library found, the following options will be ignored anyway. This means, only one option can be used out of number 2. – 4. from above. For the paths defined above, also any sub path below is searched. The search path defined is valid for all models of all FCs. There is currently no library version check implemented. The user has to provide the correct version of the libs, which fits to the models. If multiple versions of a lib are provided, CB just takes the first one found.

It generates textual and graphical content for EHANDBOOK containers out of AsciiDoc files. For EHANDBOOK, the file extension for AsciiDoc files must be either *.adoc or *.asciidoc. EHANDBOOK supports a subset of the full AsciiDoc syntax. Syntax elements that are not described below may also work, but are not guaranteed to work. The following AsciiDoc syntax elements are supported: Document Header and Section Titles Formatted Text Lists Tables Images Include Files Links Diagrams Admonition Blocks More delimited block A document header in AsciiDoc represents the title of the document. The document header is typically followed by content such as text, images, lists and tables. The content itself can be further structured through sections and subsections. The document header is specified using a single '=' character at the very beginning of the first line in a document. Sections and subsections are then created through multiple '=' characters. = Document Header Text (Level 0) == Level 1 Section Title === Level 2 Section Title ==== Level 3 Section Title For EHANDBOOK, the document header is expected as the very first line in the AsciiDoc file that represents a documentation chapter. If the document header is not present, then name of the name of the directory in which AsciiDoc file is stored will be used as document title. The titles of subsections appear in the table of contents in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The maximum nesting level for subsections is 6.

The sortable headers and the filter line is added by EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR automatically. Images can be embedded in AsciiDoc documentation. In EHANDBOOK, model screen-shots can be linked to interactive models by providing the link to model path. Image must be placed in the same folder as the AsciiDoc documentation or in a subfolder of the AsciiDoc documentation. In either case path relative to AsciiDoc documentation is expected.

AsciiDoc recognizes the following common URL schemes without the help of any markup: http/https file mailto ftp irc So the below https URL automatically turn it into a hyperlink: The EHANDBOOK homepage at https://www.etas.com/ehandbook A link to an external file works like this: file://../input/Documentation/AsciiDocUserDocument.adoc A link to a network file works like this: file://sample.com/sample/sample/sample.adoc By clicking on any of the above links, the file will be opened with the associated tool outside of EHB-NAV. AsciiDoc also detects and autolinks standard email addresses: Email us at sales.de@etas.com for any inquiries. Only absolute file paths are supported in EHANDBOOK. The appearance of the link can be configured. This happens by appending text or parameters, enclosed by a pair of square brackets. Instead of the link itself, an alternative text can be displayed. Insert that text between the square brackets at the end of the URL. https://etas.com/ehandbook[Show Homepage] will be shown as: Show Homepage Since the text is subject to normal substitutions, you can apply formatting to it.

NOTICE Incomplete container content due to defective or inconsistent input data Content of the generated EHANDBOOK Container may be missing, if the input data used for generating the container is defective or inconsistent. Affected container contents cannot be displayed or will be displayed incorrectly in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Therefore, always check the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build. Defective or inconsistent input data that have led to errors when converting will be tracked in the log file. The content consistency is in the responsibility of the data supplier (documentation publisher). We recommend that the data supplier develop a standard procedure for pre-processing the input data outside the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool chain to ensure the data consistency and to reduce the workload for reviewing the input data. In addition, the pre-processing should be properly documented to ensure transparency. After generating a new container: Check the entries in the log file of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build indicating defective or inconsistent input data. If necessary, fix the incorrect or inconsistent input data. Re-build the EHANDBOOK Container. Only provide containers for further usage in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, if the log file contains no entries, indicating any defective or inconsistent input data.","title":"AsciiDoc Specification","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_AsciiDoc_Specification","url":"/ehandbook/references/EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_AsciiDoc_Specification.html","titles":[{"text":"AsciiDoc Support in EHANDBOOK","hash":"_asciidoc_support_in_ehandbook","id":1},{"text":"Document Header and Section Titles","hash":"sections","id":2},{"text":"Formatted Text","hash":"formatted-text","id":3},{"text":"Lists","hash":"lists","id":4},{"text":"Tables","hash":"tables","id":5},{"text":"Images","hash":"images","id":6},{"text":"Embed pre-generated images","hash":"_embed_pre_generated_images","id":7},{"text":"Pre-generated Images linked with Model","hash":"_pre_generated_images_linked_with_model","id":8},{"text":"EHANDBOOK generated model screenshots linked with interactive models","hash":"_ehandbook_generated_model_screenshots_linked_with_interactive_models","id":9},{"text":"EHB generated Function Overview Image","hash":"_ehb_generated_function_overview_image","id":10},{"text":"Include Files","hash":"includes","id":11},{"text":"Inclusion of other AsciiDoc or source files","hash":"_inclusion_of_other_asciidoc_or_source_files","id":12},{"text":"Inclusion of formatted Source Code, e.g. C-Code","hash":"_inclusion_of_formatted_source_code_e_g_c_code","id":13},{"text":"Links","hash":"links","id":14},{"text":"AutoLink","hash":"_autolink","id":15},{"text":"Cutomize Link Text","hash":"_cutomize_link_text","id":16},{"text":"Customize URL and File Link Text","hash":"_customize_url_and_file_link_text","id":17},{"text":"Customize Mailto Text","hash":"_customize_mailto_text","id":18},{"text":"Link Macro","hash":"_link_macro","id":19},{"text":"Support model link","hash":"_support_model_link","id":20},{"text":"Support function overview link using link macro","hash":"_support_function_overview_link_using_link_macro","id":21},{"text":"Diagrams","hash":"diagrams","id":22},{"text":"Formulas","hash":"_formulas","id":23},{"text":"Simple formula","hash":"_simple_formula","id":24},{"text":"Scale formula with 1.5","hash":"_scale_formula_with_1_5","id":25},{"text":"Changing formula images to SVG","hash":"_changing_formula_images_to_svg","id":26},{"text":"UML Graphics","hash":"_uml_graphics","id":27},{"text":"Sequence Diagram","hash":"_sequence_diagram","id":28},{"text":"Use Case Diagram","hash":"_use_case_diagram","id":29},{"text":"Class Diagram","hash":"_class_diagram","id":30},{"text":"Components Diagram","hash":"_components_diagram","id":31},{"text":"Object Diagram","hash":"_object_diagram","id":32},{"text":"Deployment Diagram","hash":"_deployment_diagram","id":33},{"text":"Timing Diagram","hash":"_timing_diagram","id":34},{"text":"Admonition Blocks","hash":"admonitions","id":35},{"text":"Admonition Paragraph Syntax","hash":"_admonition_paragraph_syntax","id":36},{"text":"Admonition Block Syntax","hash":"_admonition_block_syntax","id":37},{"text":"More delimited block","hash":"more-delimited-blocks","id":38},{"text":"Important Notices","hash":"_important_notices","id":39}]},"47":{"id":47,"text":"The ETAS EHANDBOOK solution is an interactive documentation tool set. This solution consists in 3 parts: the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool chain for the container generation, later called EHB-CB, the container itself, which is containing the documentation data in a special format and the EHANDBOOK NAVIGATOR, the tool to work with the containers, later called EHB-NAV. Besides container generation, a PDF document can be created in addition. The configuration details of the PDF are described in detail below. The creation of the PDF document happens as an optional post-processing step after the container generation. It is invoked by a checkbox from the GUI-version of the EHB-CB Add-on or via the command line option -pdf for the CLI-version of EHB-CB. The PDF contains two tables of contents: Hierarchical software view of the function components (as in EHB-NAV) Alphabetical view of the function components The page sorting of the content for the function components is in order to the hierarchical software view. The same applies to the bookmarks, which are also available in the PDF. The styling of the PDF is configured in a file PdfCustomization.xsl formatted as XML stylesheet. The file have to be placed in the Styling folder. The styling folder location is set in the user input dialog for GUI based EHB-CB versions or via -styling command line parameter for command line based EHB-CBs. You may use different stylings, defined in separate folders and pick the de-sired one then in the user input dialog. This can be useful for different texts and stylings for different documents, like ‘Draft’ or ‘Released’ versions. The style definitions are standardized in XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO). See the following standards: https://www.w3.org/2002/08/XSLFOsummary.html https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xsl11-20061205 Here is a sample structure and a subset of possible attributes of the formatting objects for the text styling: 9pt bold italic black sans-serif The structure of the TOC and the amount of model hierarchies shown in the PDF can be configured in the eHandbookCB.ini, which is located in the installation directory of EHB-CB. For the ASCET Add-on for EHB-CB this is typically the ’tool’ sub directory of the ASCET installation. (e.g. C:\\ETAS\\ASCET6.1\\Tools\\EHANDBOOK_CB\\tool). Sample content of the eHandbookCB.ini: Independent of the amount of model hierarchies shown in the text pane of the container, there can be a screenshot printed in the PDF for every model hierarchy of the model. To do so, the following line has to be set in the eHandbookCB.ini: -DmodelSnapshotsRequired=true The amount of sub chapter levels shown in the TOC of the PDF can be configured as follows: -DpdfTocLevel=value Parameter value Description -DpdfTocLevel=All All the chapter levels will be part of table of contents -DpdfTocLevel=N -DpdfTocLevel=5 N chapter levels will be in table of contents No entry or -DpdfTocLevel=Default Chapter levels as per ASCET Project will be in table of contents. Levels till the Function Component Name as seen in EHB-NAV text pane For verbose logging information, the following line has to be set: -DdebugRequired=false (default) The style of the title page, the header image and the footer text information is taken 1:1 from the container configuration. For details, please refer to the container style guide for EHB-CB document. The style of all pages besides the title page can be customized with an XML stylesheet. A file with the name PdfCustomization.xsl must be placed within the Styling folder. The default font of the PDF documentation can be set with: Arial, sans-serif It is allowed to specify a list of fonts, which will be used. The order of the font, which will be picked from the list, is from left to right. If the font is not installed on your machine, the next font from the list will be selected. A font list of ‘Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif’ would select Arial, then Helvetica and then any other sans-serif font. The style of the header like font size, font family, color and more can be defined within the attribute-set “header_text”. Sample header text style: 9pt black sans-serif The header text alignment is set as: left The header background color is set as: start 6mm 0pt retain #00904C The style of the footer like font size, font family, color and more can be defined within the attribute-set “footer_text”. Sample footer text style: 9pt black sans-serif The footer text alignment is set as: left The style of the section’s title like font size, font family, color and more can be defined within the attribute-sets “topic.title”, “topic.topic.title” and “topic.topic.topic.title”. Example for the section title text style: #FF4400 1.77em Arial,sans-serif Example for first level subsection style: #FF4400 1.77em Arial,sans-serif Subsection styles can be provided within the following attribute sets: topic.title (section title) topic.topic.title (first level subsection) topic.topic.topic.title (second level subsection) The style of the paragraph like font size, font family, color and more can be defined within the attribute-set “p”. Sample paragraph style: 10pt Times New Roman, serif The style of tables like font size, font family, color and more can be defined within the attribute-set “table.data”. Sample table text style: Times New Roman 10pt blue The Figure background color can be defined within the attribute-set “fig”. Sample Figure style: white If a chapter name exceeds the page width, then chapter name overlaps with page number and not shown completely in table of contents.

Typically, per sub directory (which normally corresponds to a function component) you can place one single RTF document there, together with the model file. This content is then transformed into the EHB container in the text pane of the function component and describes verbally the functionality of the corresponding model. This document provides a comprehensive information on the features within RTF that is supported by EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool. RTF format is supported according to the Rich Text specification version 1.9.1, but as a rudimentary subset only. Supported functionalities are described below. As a generating tool for RTF, MS Word in Version 2013 is given. MS WordPad is not supported. Other tools or versions of MS Word may work also, but not guaranteed by ETAS. The RTF file input is only supported by the directory based EHB-CB versions. File size is limited to 120 MB, see chapter Other known Limitations. The RTF specification provided by Microsoft gives the user the ability to create large variety of different data within the document file. For the scope of EHB, the support of plain text and standard graphics is provided only. Currently, the features supported by EHB-CB tool are as follows: Paragraphs Chapters Images Model links from RTF Tables Paragraphs within RTF includes different combinations of characters, words and other different text representation. The plain text is completely supported in the tool, which gets represented as a paragraph output HTML documentation. Other detailed support given within the plain text are as follows: Text formatting Unicode/Language support Bullets & Lists As the EHB solution is using its own numbering system, the original numbering of chapters and figure legends and other numbered references will be ignored. Text formatting including color, font, style (bold, italic, underline) is not supported. Text alignment is also not supported, even in table cells. Paragraph alignments are not supported in paragraphs as following the intermediate DITA standards. Text has to be in single-column. If the characters used in paragraph don’t belong to the standard ANSI characters, they are represented in RTF as Unicode’s. These Unicode’s help represent different language characters in code form. Different language support implementation is completely in place with the help of these Unicode identification and text conversion using standard libraries. Input: Output in EHB-NAV: Many varieties of bullet characters are offered by the bullet library of Microsoft. Currently EHB support Numbering completely in the list and Bullets of different characters are converted to a generic symbol – “•” or “o”, depending on the input. List within table is also supported. Following figure depicts the comparison of Input RTF in word on the left side and the final output inside EHANDBOOK NAVIGATOR on the right side. Tables in RTF are basically structured data which are stored in rows and columns. There are different types of tables in RTF. The supported ones are: Simple tables Complex tables – as unstructured tables only Simple tables contains data with uniform number of cells in each rows of the table. For example: SL No. Name Last Name 1 Tom Hanks 2 Ethan Hunt Complex tables contain irregular number of cells in each row. For Example: 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 FC Name: FlexECU Phys - Equation Equation=PhysX2 Limit Equation ~65332 Limitations for table support in EHB: Tables must contain more than one cell Complex tables – as nested tables are currently not supported Only plain text in cells is allowed, no other objects, like images Tables are always rendered with thin frame lines in EHB-NAV, independent of the table styling in RTF. Text alignment and line breaks may rendered in NAV differently than in the RTF source Output example in EHB-NAV: Different chapters in RTF are identified in Container using the different header styling given to the text. Firstly, the TOC table of the RTF document is processed for chapter bookmarks and prepared for chapter identification. This step is followed by identifying subchapter using both the header styles and field data identified in RTF. Detailed understanding of the process is as follows: Bookmark from TOC table Style sheet identifies the styles starting with “Heading” as chapter heading. Main chapters in RTF are identified using the main table of content fields in the documentation. Example TOC table: In case of unavailability of TOC table, style property of the heading text is considered for chapter identification. Chapters and subchapters in RTF documents are identified via the style associated to the heading. If the style is of type “Heading” i.e., if the style property starts with the prefix “Heading”. These headings are then converted to subchapters of their parent chapter. Input Example in an RTF file: Output in EHB-NAV: RTF provides different image file formats to be embedded inside the document. The following image types are currently supported: Joint Photographic Experts Group – (JPEG) Portable Network Graphics - (PNG) Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) are only supported, if they contain plain, un-scaled and un-tailored images only. Text, formulas and other elements may look scattered in EHB-NAV later. EMF and WMF are converted to standard PNG format with standard SWT interfaces for EHB-NAV support. EHB offers a linking mechanism between model figures inside RTF documents and their respective model hierarchy within the functional component (FC) in both directions. In EHB-NAV this will look as follows: The model figure is shown with a button “Open interactive model” in the text pane. By click on it, the corresponding model hierarchy is opened in the model explorer. Here the pop-up menu “Show in Documentation” navigates you back to the model figure in the text pane. In this case, the model figure is directly embedded in the RTF document. To invoke the linkage, the following syntax in the RTF has to be used: Model image identifier keyword [Model] Followed by the model snapshot image Model hierarchy path below the image whose text style is of type “Caption” (exact hierarchy path of the model from which the image snapshot is taken) This works for ASCET and Simulink models. Total length of sub hierarchy path and model name is limited to one text line only. If necessary, reduce the font size to achieve this. The model hierarchy path is not verified by EHB-CB Tool. In case the model link path specified is invalid, no link will be created. RTF input sample for the EHB-NAV view shown above: In this case, the model figure is generated by EHB-CB out of the interactive model and placed into the EHB-NAV text pane from the RTF content. Major advantages: No manual model screenshot generation required No update of model figures required, if changes in model were made ClickPic possible (Model navigation in text pane of EHB-NAV) File size of the RTF document keeps small To invoke the image generation and model linkage, the following syntax in the RTF has to be used: For ASCET or Simulink models: Model image identifier keyword [ehbmodelref] Model hierarchy path directly below in text style of type “Caption” (exact hierarchy path of the model from which the image snapshot is taken) Constraints for the model path: If a SL model refers to another model file, e.g. a library, the model path has to start from the beginning of this library file For C-Code: Model image identifier keyword [ehbmodelref] C-filename.c/SubFunctionName directly below in text style of type “Caption” Constraints for c-code: Only the very most top sub functions of the c-file can be defined and selected for the graphic All elements of the model are shown in unexpanded view The c-file or model is in the same location as the RTF file Depending on the code size, the image of the interactive model may be too big to be shown fully in the text pane or be in reduced downsized view to fit in. Only the very most top sub functions of the c-file can be defined and selected for the graphic All elements of the model are shown in unexpanded view The c-file is in the same location as the RTF file Depending on the code size, the image of the interactive model may be too big to be shown fully in the text pane or be in reduced downsized view to fit in. Total length of sub hierarchy path and model name is limited to one text line only. If necessary, reduce the font size to achieve this. The model hierarchy path or sub function name is not verified by EHB-CB Tool. In case the model link path specified is invalid, no image and no link will be created. | The RTF converter allows to show a Function Overview Diagram within the textual content in the container. This diagram is generated by EHB and shows all inputs and outputs of a module. It has also a link to its interactive model. For this, a location in the text should be defined with below format. The image content will be inserted in the existing text flow where the format is provided. Definition in RTF document: [ehbfunctionoverview-begin] List of function names separated by comma (“,”) [ehbfunctionoverview-end] The function names provided here are the function component folder name which will have the metadata excel file. Example: [ehbfunctionoverview-begin] Actuators,Amf,Afr [ehbfunctionoverview-end] To provide all the functions in documentation, below format can be provided. Definition in RTF document: [ehbfunctionoverview-all] The RTF converter allows to integrate additional textual content, e.g. c-code source files into the container. For this, the location in the text is defined by the header keyword [ehbinline] and the name of the file. The file content will be inserted in the existing text flow. In principle, any kind of text file can be integrated. Definition in RTF document: [ehbinline] filename Example: [ehbinline] codename.c Constraints: The file content is displayed as pure text only The source file is in the same location as the RTF-file EHB-CB tool currently does not support the following data: OLE – Object Linking and Embedding These are basically objects that are embedded to rtf document from another source like – excel, PowerPoint, Equations etc. At present, the tool throws a warning information when such objects are encountered. Diagram Objects (DO) These are special complex images, which are variety of shapes and texts embedded into it. We are currently not supporting this data. Header & Footers These data are currently trimmed from RTF conversion, as exclusive styling feature is incorporated in EHB-NAV for custom header and footers in documentation. Watermarks No support of watermarks (background image on every page). Images should be removed in advance of the build process. We are able to provide an adapted CCS in EHB-CB to integrate this functionality if required. Documents within Review State / Revisions MS Word allows to mark, check and follow-up of text changes. This functionality is not supported Hyperlinks/Bookmarks Apart from the points above mentioned, many different data can be included in RTF as defined in Microsoft RTF specification. If those data are not mentioned in this document, it by default means that they are not yet a part of the conversion into EHB. For every graphics embedded in the RTF document, an additional title with a figure number is generated and later displayed centralized in NAV. If smaller graphics are in the text inline, the result may look hard to read. Due to heap space memory constrains in EHB-CB, the file size of an RTF document is limited to 120 MB. If the file is bigger, it is excluded from the container generation and an error message is written into the log file. To overcome this limitation and for general performance reasons and easier version handling ETAS recommend, not embedding model images at all, but use model linking.

A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block: Selector Declaration Declaration /* Selector */ h1 { /* Property : Value */ color: blue; /* Property : Value */ font-size: 12px; } The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. These entries are defined in the commonltr.css file. A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\styling\\commonltr.css) To change the footer text style, the following section is used: .footer { white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; position: relative } To modify the text style, the following section is used: body { font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 20px; color: #0000F0; word-wrap: break-word; } To modify the text style for paragraphs: p { font-size: 15pt; } To change the styling of the headings, the following section is used: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { font-weight: bold; color: #3683ab; margin: 7px; } To show the top header with grey background color: h1 { background-color: #f0f0f0; } In containers, generated with the directory based EHB-CB, the top header names may appear twice: This can be avoided with the following configuration: .topictitle1 { display: none; } To remove the double header in PDF the following code must be added in the PdfCustomization.xsl: 0px To change the styling of the tagged labels or links, the following section is used: a { text-decoration: underline; color: #3683ab; } To change the styling of the tables, the following section is used: table { font-size: 10.5px; border: solid; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; width: 100%; } This will change the table header styling: th { background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; } This will change the table elements text: td { font-size: 15px; color: black; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; } You can use your own corporate font, by adding it in a sub folder: @font-face { font-family: 'ETASfont'; src: url('../fonts/Roboto-Thin.woff') format('woff'), font-style: normal; } body { font-family: ETASfont, Arial, sans-serif; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; padding: 20px; color: #000000; word-wrap: break-word; } The font files are located in the sub folder fonts here. Font ‘woff2’ format is also possible. You can define a watermark image, which will appear in the background of every page. /* Watermark as background image */ body { /* Watermark image */ background-image: url(\"watermark.jpg\"); /* Repeat background vertically */ background-repeat: repeat-y; /* Center the background */ background-position: center; } The file ‘watermark.jpg’ must be located next to the css file in this example here.","title":"Container Style Guide","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_Styling_Guide__EHB_Container","url":"/ehandbook/references/EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_Styling_Guide__EHB_Container.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Styling Folder","hash":"styling_folder","id":2},{"text":"Branding.properties File","hash":"branding-properties","id":3},{"text":"Header Image","hash":"_header_image","id":4},{"text":"Footer Text","hash":"_footer_text","id":5},{"text":"commonltr.css File","hash":"_commonltr_css_file","id":6},{"text":"Footer Configuration","hash":"_footer_configuration","id":7},{"text":"Text Configuration","hash":"_text_configuration","id":8},{"text":"Header Configuration","hash":"_header_configuration","id":9},{"text":"Label and Link Configuration","hash":"_label_and_link_configuration","id":10},{"text":"Label Table Configuration","hash":"_label_table_configuration","id":11},{"text":"Usage of Company Font in the Container","hash":"_usage_of_company_font_in_the_container","id":12},{"text":"Setting a Watermark Image","hash":"_setting_a_watermark_image","id":13}]},"50":{"id":50,"text":"The title page for a container can be defined as an SVG image, which must be placed in the styling folder, described above. The name of the SVG image must be title_page.svg A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\styling\\ title_page.svg) You can create any style with images, logos and text as you want by using a graphic program, e.g. the freeware tool Inkscape. (https://inkscape.org) There exists a set of predefined placeholder variables, which can be placed into the SVG image. The font styling (type, size, color etc.) of the variable in the SVG will be used directly. A variable is in upper cases, marked with a ‘$’ sign and enclosed in curly brackets ${VARIABLE}. The set of variables depends on the type of the EHB-CB. All variables must be written in upper case! If an undefined variable is used in title_page.svg, no title page is generated! One possibility is to use default values for variables. With $\\{VARIABLE!} the variable defaults to empty and does not cause an error when the variable is not defined. See documentation: Default value operator in expressions ${ROOT_FOLDER} = name of the input folder for the container generation ${CONTAINER_INPUT} = name of the input folder for the container generation [ To be used with EHANDBOOK CONTAINER BUILD 11.2 versions onwards ] ${EHB_FILE_NAME} = file name of the container without file extension ${FOOTER_TEXT} = footer text out of the branding.properties file (see chapter Branding.properties File) ${PRODUCT_NAME} = name of the EHB-CB tool used for container generation ${PRODUCT_VERSION} = version of the EHB-CB tool used for container generation The project information is fetched from the tags defined in the root ABLOCK out of the CCX file: ehbContainer Detailed PVER V7.1.1 3 EHANDBOOK Demo SWCALDOC DE Software Documentation Copy right ETAS GmbH ... Each tag within with any name specified in can be used as a placeholder variable. E.g. for V7.1.1 the placeholder variable will be ${Project_variant} and the content later shown on the title page will be V7.1.1 then. The project information is fetched mostly from the GUI input fields. ${PROJECT_TITLE} = text entered in ‘Project title’ ${SOFTWARE_VERSION} = text entered in ‘Software version’ ${SPECIFICATION_VERSION} = text entered in ‘Specification version’ $\\{GENERATION_DATE?date} = date entered in ‘Generation date’ ${ASCET_VERSION} = ASCET version used for container generation For the GENERATION_DATE variable the date format can also be specified: E.g. set $\\{GENERATION_DATE?string('dd.MM.yyyy’)!} in SVG to get date in dd.mm.yyyy format. For all EHB-CBs a date variable can be specified in a special way, directly inside a comment block of the SVG graphic. To get access to it, you have to open and edit the title_page.svg with a text editor, e.g. Notepad++: --> ... This comment block is parsed and interpreted by EHB-CB. The placeholder variable for the date is defined here as $DATE_TIME} and holds the current date and time. It can be formatted in many ways, e.g. \"dd.MM.yyyy\" → 15.04.2020 \"MMM/dd/yyyy\" → Apr/15/2020 \"EEEE, MMMM dd, yyyy, hh:mm a\" → Tuesday, April 15, 2020, 09:24 PM \"HH:mm\" → 21:24 For more details regarding format possibilities have a look at https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_builtins_date.html You can use macros to define placeholder variables as logical switches. So depending of the value of one or more placeholder variables a different fixed text is shown. This can be used to show texts in different languages, depending of e.g. a ${LANGUAGE} variable, read from CCX. Alternatively, you can use e.g. the ${ROOT_FOLDER} to code different longer texts on the title page. To achieve this, you have to edit the SVG in a text editor, see chapter Current Date Placeholder Variable The macro is also defined in the comment block of the SVG. Here an example for a multi-language title page: --> The variables LANGUAGE and DOC_CLASS above are fetched from the CCX. The variable DOCTYPE_TEXT is defined here in the title_page.svg. To show its assigned content, you have to place ${DOCTYPE_TEXT} at any position in the SVG. For more programming possibilities, please have a look at https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/index.html If a text exceeds the page width, the remaining part gets truncated. To avoid this, word wrap as a macro is possible and the following code has to be placed into the SVG: width)> $\\{'\\n'}$\\{text} $\\{wordwrap(text?substring(wrap + 1), width, x, y + dy, dy)} $\\{'\\n'}$\\{text} --> With Inkscape, you can now place your text variable at any position inside the image like this: $\\{wordwrap(FOOTER_TEXT, 105, 23, 150, 15)} The parameters are defined as follows: parameter: text variable to be shown (here $FOOTER_TEXT) parameter: maximum amount of characters in the line (here 105) parameter: insertion from the left side in pixel (here 23) parameter: insertion from the top side in pixel (here 150) parameter: distance to previous line in pixel (here 15) Besides the predefined variables described above, the user can define his own variables in addition. This works as follows: Place any variable names into the title page SVG, e.g. $\\{USER_VAR_1!} Create a text file named as title_page.properties. and place it in the same location as the title_page.svg. In the file you can specify the variables and their textual content. The file is in JAVA properties format, which looks like this: User_Var_1 = any text which should appear here User_Var_2 = any text which should appear here …​ A sample file is available in the examples sub folder of the EHB-CB installation directory. (..\\examples\\styling\\title_page.properties) If you are specifying a predefined placeholder variable name also in the title_page.properties file, only the text from the file is fetched. Variable names in the file are case insensitive, but in the SVG they must be written in upper case always. No line break in text allowed, usage of word wrap required, see chapter Word Wrap as Macro The file must be in Java properties format as ANSI text and UTF-8 encoded only It is recommended, to use the variables always with ‘!’, e.g. $\\{PROJECT_NAME!} If Inkscape is used, you must save the images only with save as…​ standard svg As the EHB macros are defined as comments in the SVG, ensure, that the graphic tool is not removing it.

Step 4: Log information can be seen in the command prompt console. Step 5: Once the EHANDBOOK container creation is successful, the below message can be seen on the command prompt console: \"INFO - Container creation successful! [path in which container is created]\" Now, the output folder contains an EHANDBOOK container (extension .ehb) by the name passed with -n argument If the tool is executed without any command line parameter, just by double click on eHandbookCB.exe, a small GUI-window will appear. Here now, the major input parameters (but not all) can be specified in an interactive way. Mandatory entries are marked with a '*'. The intention of this feature is to simplify test and evaluation purposes. ASAM based GUI Mode: To enable this GUI in the standard EHB-CB tool, -Dasam.cb=true has to be added in the ehandbookCB.ini file, located in the same folder as the eHandbookCB.exe. Directory based GUI Mode: Type in the mandatory information: Input location (Dir based): Select the top most folder, which contains the input files CCX file path (ASAM based): Select the path to the ASAM CCX file Output folder: Specify the output directory, where the container will be generated. Of course, this directory should be separated from the input location! GUI Mode is supported only for Windows Operating System. EHB file Name: Defines the name of the EHANDBOOK container, file extension .ehb is added Optional arguments: SIMLIB path: Path outside of the input folder to exactly one root directory to all Simulink libraries used by the models in the input folder. Styling folder: Location of folder containing the styling information (title page, fonts, company logo etc…). If nothing is specified, a default title page is generated. Generate SVG: Enables auto generated model screenshots, if text input files are configured accordingly. See Click Pic for more details. Allow MATLAB connection: Use MATLAB for enhanced rendering of Simulink models. Matlab has to be installed on the PC. When this option is set, the container generation takes considerable more time. For more details on the input arguments, see the command line list [cmd-list] above Start the generation by pressing the ‘Generate’-button. After processing, the generated container is available then in the directory specified as output folder. If no container is generated, because of a fatal error, a log file in the output folder is written by the EHB-CB tool. In all other cases, irrespective of an error occurred or not, a log file with the name of the container (ContainerName.log) is placed inside the container. The log file can be read by unzipping the container with a standard zipping tool (e.g. 7-zip) or by opening the container in EHB-NAV and using the menu Help→Export Log Files…​ . In addition to the command line parameters, there are also some special configurations in the eHandbookCB.ini file possible. This file is located in the same directory as the eHandbookCB.exe. It is a plain text file and can be edited with any text editor. However user can also configure this special configurations via command-line argument \"-vmargs\", see the command line list [cmd-list]. For running EHB-CB in multi instance mode, the following have to be specified: Add the following arguments for the Java Runtime Environment into the eHandbookCB.ini file: -Dosgi.instance.area=”dir path” (Must be different for each EHB-CB instance) -Dosgi.configuration.area=”dir path” (Must be different for each EHB-CB instance) -Djava.io.tmpdir=”dir path” (Optional) Handling of temporary files. This parameter is optional, if not supplied, EHB-CB handles creation of separate temp directory created for multi-instance within @user.home\\AppData\\Local\\Temp Launch of EHB-CB with the additional command line parameter: -lockDir ”dir path” (Must be identical for all EHB-CB instances) Required to handle lock for PDF FLY as it support single instance only and other EHB-CB instance waits until the first EHB-CB instance completes the image conversion using PDF FLY. Please refer to the sample below with parameters that need to be provided for running EHB-CB in multi instance mode: eHandbookCB.exe (1) -i \"D:\\TestData\\Asam_Data\\input\\asamCC.ccx\" -o \"D:\\TestData\\Container\\output\" -n \"EhcbDemoContainer\" -lockdir \"D:\\LockDir\" -vmargs -Dosgi.instance.area=@user.home/EHANDBOOK-CB/instance -Dosgi.configuration.area=@user.home/EHANDBOOK-CB/configuration -Djava.io.tmpdir=\"D:\\temDir\" 1 On Linux use the executable eHandbookCB All the above parameters must be used consistently in a Batch Job Server environment. Incomplete parameter supply will result in inconsistent behavior of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build. | The maximum RAM memory that EHANDBOOK Container-Build is allowed to use is specified within the -Xmx parameter in the eHandbookCB.ini file. In this example, the memory limit is set to 8 GB: -startup plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.5.100.v20180827-1352.jar --launcher.library plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.800.v20180827-1352 --launcher.appendVmargs -vmargs -Xms256m -Xmx8g (1) --add-modules=java.xml.bind -Dorg.eclipse.update.reconcile=false 1 Set maximum RAM to 8 GB. Refer to, System Requirements In order to render the graphics of Simulink blocks appropriately, a connection to MATLAB is required. By default a connection from Container-Build to MATLAB is enabled and established when converting Simulink models. In order to prevent a connection to MATLAB, the command line option -nomatlab can be used. With an active MATLAB connection, images of Simulink block masks or block decorations are exported and are available as an overlay on the respective block when loaded in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The command line parameter -matlabpath uses MATLAB during the build process for Simulink mask generation. This happens via a MATLAB API connection. To ensure, that EHB-CB is not blocked, there is a configurable timeout, if the connection hangs for any reason. For this, the parameter -DmatlabTimeoutThreshold=value can be specified in the eHandbookCB.ini file. The value should be an integer and unit corresponds to minute. In the following example, the timeout is set to 10 minutes: -DmatlabTimeoutThreshold=10 Without any given timeout specification in the ini-file, the default is set to 5 minutes. If the timeout occurs, the established MATLAB connection will be terminated immediately. The EHANDBOOK Container-Build process continues without any connection retry, therefore no more mask images are generated. An error is logged in the log file. Performance of Simulink model conversion has been improved by introducing caching mechanism for referenced Simulink models. This is achieved by caching the libraries that are already converted. For this, the parameter -DsimulinkLibraryCacheSize=value can be specified in the eHandbookCB.ini file. The value should be an integer and unit corresponds to number of libraries. In this example, the cached number of library modules is set to 50: -DsimulinkLibraryCacheSize=50 Without any given specification in the eHandbookCB.ini file, the default is set to cache 100 library models. This caching has a major impact of the overall memory consumption of EHANDBOOK Container-Build. When many and/or huge libraries are cached and only a small amount of RAM is specified for EHANDBOOK Container-Build, the tool may crash with an out of memory error! In this case you have to decrease the amount of cached libraries or increase the RAM, as described in chapter RAM Usage. We have realized that MATLAB becomes slower and slower the longer the API connection is established. So, the performance of Simulink mask generation has been improved by introducing restart of MATLAB connections. This is achieved by configuring -DrestartMatlabConnectionForModelCount=value which can be specified in the eHandbookCB.ini file. Value should be in integer and unit corresponds to number of models after the MATLAB connection is restated. In this example, the MATLAB connection is restarted every 30 models: -DrestartMatlabConnectionForModelCount=30 If no restart should happen, the value has to be set to =0 Without any given specification in the ini-file, the default is set to restart MATLAB connection for every 25 models. Performance of Simulink mask generation has been improved by using multiple CPU threads of the used PC system. Parallelization for mask generation is based on configured number of threads running on each instance of MATLAB. This is achieved by configuring -DthreadCountForMaskGeneration=value which can be specified in the eHandbookCB.ini file or as a command line argument -vmargs -DthreadCountForMaskGeneration. Value should be in integer and unit corresponds to number of CPU threads used for parallelization during mask generation. In this example, 4 CPU threads are used: -DthreadCountForMaskGeneration=4 Without a configuration for -DthreadCountForMaskGeneration=value, the default value is set to 2 CPU threads. If value is set to 0, negative or invalid also the default is used. Each MATLAB instance is bound to exactly one CPU core. The number should be configured carefully. Keep in mind whether your system can run as many MATLAB instances as configured (availability of RAM, CPU speed, disk access speed, etc.). Otherwise you might overload your system completely if too many threads are configured. If you configure e.g. -DthreadCountForMaskGeneration=100, but your input to Container-Build contains only one Simulink model then Container-Build will only start one MATLAB instance. If you configure e.g. -DthreadCountForMaskGeneration=100, but only one CPU core is available on the machine then Container-Build will only start one MATLAB instance. The number of effectively used MATLAB instances will be stated in the log as: threadCountForMaskGeneration is set to Performance of Simulink mask generation has been improved by introducing a caching mechanism for Simulink mask types. Types with same mask data should be considered for caching. For this, the types of masks can be configured with -DtypesForMaskGenerationCaching=type1,type2,…​ in the eHandbookCB.ini file. Example: If a block mask data has parameter \"Type\" with value TL_out or TL_in which are used in many blocks, such types can be cached as -DtypesForMaskGenerationCaching=TL_out,TL_in If the data of the mask type is different in Simulink blocks, such types should not be cached as this results in incorrect mask generation. Example: If two blocks has mask data has parameter \"Type\" with value TL_out but the mask commands are different then such types should not be cached. Not all the mask data is currently interpreted by EHANDBOOK Container-Build. To overcome this, there is a new option which exports the Simulink Mask as an image and shows them in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The option is enabled by default, to switch to mask interpretation add the following entry in the eHandbookCB.ini file: -DenableSimulinkMaskInterpretation=true By default, the option is disabled and set to false. The Simulink mask decorations as image is currently supported only for blocks which are rectangular in shape. This option requires a MATLAB connection for the build process. The earlier option -DenableSimulinkMaskDecorationsAsImage is deprecated. With simulink mask decoration as image approach, it is possible to generate mask images for selected rectangular blocks with mask applied on them. A list of rectangular blocks with mask are identified and listed in eHandbookCB.ini file: -DrectangularBlocksWithMask By default, this option specifies a set of rectangular blocks with mask applied on them. This list can be further extended with additional rectangular blocks with masks on them. Mask Icons in Simulink are not generated for Plot Commands. Display property of a masked block does not have plot information from MATLAB 2017a onwards. Hence mask icons are not generated for such blocks. Alternatively, use the option -DenableSimulinkMaskInterpretation command. Currently EHANDBOOK has some limitations on Simulink Annotations which contain rich text formatting. To overcome this, there is a new option which extracts the textual content from rich text annotations and shows them as text in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The option can be enabled with the following option: -DsimulinkAnnotationsAsText=true Some rich text formattings like tables and images are currently not supported. Typically, you will have only one Simulink file per sub directory (Directory Based EHB-CB) or per functional component (ASAM based EHB-CB). EHB-CB also supports multiple Simulink files, where one main model file is referencing other model files. To make this happen, all files must be zipped, where the zipped file name must match to the main model name (default behavior). There should not be any hierarchy within the zip folder. If this is not the case, you can specify one or more suffixes, which will be ignored from the zip name to still allow name matching with the main model name: -DsimulinkZipSuffix=suffix1,suffix2 This option accepts multiple suffixes with comma separated values. Mask documentation (referred as Base documentation) can be associated with a library model or a referenced model. Further uses are allowed to add an additional documentation (Referred as Custom Documentation) to the instance of library model or referenced model used in their model. In EHANDBOOK, mask documentation are indicated with tooltip as follows: If a library block has a custom mask, then the documentation contents for the custom mask shall be shown in the tooltip. If a library block has a base mask, but no custom mask, then the documentation contents for the base mask shall be shown in the tooltip. MATLAB provides capabilities to create protected models. In EHANDBOOK, such protected models are made non-expandable in order to maintain the confidentiality of the content. PDF generation using command line argument -pdf is a multithreaded operation. This operation uses all the existing logical CPU cores available on the system for conversion. This might impact the overall system performance. In order to make PDF generation more optimal, the maximum number of used threads that get spawned during PDF generation can be configured. If the number of threads configured is greater than available logical CPU cores, then all the available logical cores are utilized. -DthreadCountForPdfGeneration=4 This option accepts integer value. ASCET project component serves as an entry point for processing an ASCET model in EHANDBOOK. However a user might not define an ASCET project in an ASCET model. In such an instance, EHANDBOOK would consider components with names matching with the ASCET model name for processing. Component types which are considered for name matching and processing further are as follows: ASCET_MODULE AUTOSAR_SOFTWARE_COMPONENT StateMachine This behavior can be configured with the following argument. -DaxlFileWithNoProjectComponent ASCET project specification serves as an reference for processing components in an ASCET model in EHANDBOOK. However we could generate kaom and svg for the white-listed components specified in a JSON which are not part of specification. In such an instance, EHANDBOOK would consider such components in the ASCET model name for processing. This behavior can be configured with the following argument. -DascetGenerateAllComponents Per default, the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool starts with the GUI for Directory-based input data (i.e., if no command line parameters are given). To start the tool with the GUI for ASAM-based input data, the following entry has to be added in the eHandbookCB.ini file: -Dasam.cb=true","title":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build Usage in General","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_User_Guide__EHB_CB_Usage_In_General","url":"/ehandbook/references/EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_User_Guide__EHB_CB_Usage_In_General.html","titles":[{"text":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build Usage in Command-line Mode","hash":"_ehandbook_container_build_usage_in_command_line_mode","id":1},{"text":"List of UGG command line parameters:","hash":"_list_of_ugg_command_line_parameters","id":2},{"text":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build Usage in GUI Mode","hash":"_ehandbook_container_build_usage_in_gui_mode","id":3},{"text":"Container Debugging and Content Checking","hash":"_container_debugging_and_content_checking","id":4},{"text":"Configurations in eHandbookCB.ini","hash":"ehandbook-cb-ini","id":5},{"text":"Running EHB-CB in Multi Instance Mode","hash":"_running_ehb_cb_in_multi_instance_mode","id":6},{"text":"RAM Usage","hash":"ram-usage","id":7},{"text":"MATLAB Connection","hash":"matlab-connection","id":8},{"text":"Timeout for MATLAB Connection","hash":"matlab-timeout","id":9},{"text":"Caching Mechanism for Simulink Referenced Models","hash":"_caching_mechanism_for_simulink_referenced_models","id":10},{"text":"Parallelization for Simulink Mask Image Generation","hash":"mask-image-gen","id":11},{"text":"Re-start MATLAB Connection for Model Count","hash":"_re_start_matlab_connection_for_model_count","id":12},{"text":"Thread Count for Simulink Mask Generation","hash":"thread_count_for_simulink_mask_generation","id":13},{"text":"Types for Simulink Mask Image Generation Caching","hash":"_types_for_simulink_mask_image_generation_caching","id":14},{"text":"Simulink Mask Decorations as Image","hash":"simulink-mask-decorations-as-image","id":15},{"text":"Simulink Rich Text Annotations as Text","hash":"simulink-rich-text-annotations-as-text","id":16},{"text":"Name Matching for zipped Simulink Main Files","hash":"name-matching","id":17},{"text":"Handling of Simulink Mask Documentation for library models and referenced models","hash":"mask-documentation","id":18},{"text":"Simulink Protected Model","hash":"protected-simulink-model","id":19},{"text":"Thread Configuration for PDF Generation","hash":"thread-configuration-for-PDF-Generation","id":20},{"text":"ASCET models without ASCET project component","hash":"asect-models-without-ascet-project","id":21},{"text":"ASCET models with white-listed project components","hash":"asect-models-with-white-list-project-components","id":22},{"text":"ASAM GUI Mode","hash":"_asam_gui_mode","id":23}]},"52":{"id":52,"text":"Long names are missing in Systemconstant table when long names are not available in SYSVAL file.

Functional components containing more than one model, with same model name results in overwriting of artifacts. Model names in functional components must be unique. Functional components with same name are not supported. This is relevant to ASAM-based product. Due to heap space memory constrains in EHB-CB, the file size of an RTF document is limited to 120 MB.

Further reading: https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/displaying-signal-properties.html Mask icon generation time has increased by a factor of up to 3 when a model generated from any Simulink version is run on MATLAB 2019a and above versions. This is a limitation of MATLAB itself. Typically while processing Simulink Annotations which contain rich text, only the textual content is extracted and displayed in EHANDBOOK Navigator. However associated formatting/styling is not applied. For model screenshots of ASCET class block diagrams, there is no possibility to open a corresponding interactive model. I.e., the button \"Open Interactive Model\" is not available for model screenshots embedded in the textual documentation. The reason for this is that interactive models in EHANDBOOK are instance models, i.e. it contains instances of ASCET classes and their block diagrams. Due to the reusable concept of ASCET classes, there can be multiple instances for an ASCET class in an interactive model. As there is no clear relation between the model screenshot of the ASCET class and a concrete instance in the interactive model, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR does not offer a direct navigation.","title":"Limitations","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_User_Guide__Limitations","url":"/ehandbook/references/EHANDBOOK_Container-Build_User_Guide__Limitations.html","titles":[{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":1},{"text":"Missing Long Names in Systemconstant Table","hash":"_missing_long_names_in_systemconstant_table","id":2},{"text":"File Format in UTF-8 only","hash":"_file_format_in_utf_8_only","id":3},{"text":"Missing Word Wrapping within Tables in PDF Document","hash":"_missing_word_wrapping_within_tables_in_pdf_document","id":4},{"text":"Functional Components Models must have unique Names","hash":"_functional_components_models_must_have_unique_names","id":5},{"text":"Functional Components must have unique Short-Names","hash":"_functional_components_must_have_unique_short_names","id":6},{"text":"RTF File Size Limit","hash":"_rtf_file_size_limit","id":7},{"text":"Formatting text are not supported in AsciiDoc links","hash":"_formatting_text_are_not_supported_in_asciidoc_links","id":8},{"text":"MATLAB Simulink","hash":"_matlab_simulink","id":9},{"text":"LaTeX Markup as Text in Simulink is not supported","hash":"_latex_markup_as_text_in_simulink_is_not_supported","id":10},{"text":"TeX Markup as Masks in Simulink is not supported","hash":"_tex_markup_as_masks_in_simulink_is_not_supported","id":11},{"text":"MATLAB Workspace or mat-Files are not processed","hash":"_matlab_workspace_or_mat_files_are_not_processed","id":12},{"text":"Simulink Overlay Information is not shown","hash":"_simulink_overlay_information_is_not_shown","id":13},{"text":"Mask Icons Generation takes longer using MATLAB 2019a onwards","hash":"_mask_icons_generation_takes_longer_using_matlab_2019a_onwards","id":14},{"text":"Simulink Rich Text Annotations as Text","hash":"_simulink_rich_text_annotations_as_text","id":15},{"text":"ASCET","hash":"_ascet","id":16},{"text":"Model Linking is not possible for Class Definitions","hash":"_model_linking_is_not_possible_for_class_definitions","id":17}]},"53":{"id":53,"text":"The ETAS XLSX-converter add-on for the directory based EHANDBOOK Container-Build toolchain generates model interface data out of XLSX files and aggregate them in an internal meta-data database in the container. Typically, per sub directory (which normally corresponds to a function component) you can place one single XLS file there, together with the model file. Model interface data means all variables and parameters, including their meta-data like compu-method or data type and the corresponding interfaces of a Simulink or ASCET model or c-code. E.g. which variable is exported by a function and which variable is imported by another function. This will allow enhanced EHB-NAV features like Label Tagging, Label-Popup, Search Proposals, Function Overview, Importing/Exporting Functions. The database content is also used for the search indexing process in EHB-CB. The mapping procedure for the EHB-NAV feature “Function Overview” is purely named based, which means the name of a parameter or variable that is exported by one function has to be the same for the function that is importing it. This implies also, that every label name has to be unique. That is the same paradigm as in the existing a2l specification. This document provides a comprehensive information on the features and required structure within XLSX that is supported by EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool. For Simulink models, there is also a way to auto generate this xls file directly from the model via a m-script. ETAS can offer a sample for this. As a generating tool for the requested input XLSX-format, MS EXCEL in Version 2013 is given. Other tools or versions of MS EXCEL may work also, but not guaranteed by ETAS. The XLSX file input is only supported by the directory based EHB-CB versions. Exactly one XLSX file per functional component (per Simulink/ASCET model or c-code) in the same directory location as the model file is required. The name of the xls-file is of no relevance. In the XLSX you have to specify two separate work sheets: the sheet “Calibration” (for calibration parameters) and the sheet “Signal” (for measurement signals). Per sheet, the following columns are required: Mandatory: Column name “Xref”: (Shown in EHB tables as column: MODE) Only the following values are allowed: Xref values in Calibration sheet DEF parameters, which are defined in this function shown in EHB parameter table as value export REF parameters, which are used in this function, but defined in another function shown in EHB parameter table as value import LOC parameter is only locally used inside the function shown in EHB parameter table as value local Xref values in Signal sheet IN signal is read in or imported by this function shown in EHB variable table as value import OUT signal is written out or exported by this function shown in EHB variable table as value export LOC signal is only a local variable inside the function shown in EHB variable table as value local Optional: Column name “Class”: type of the element, any text entry in cell allowed (Shown in EHB tables as column: TYPE) Mandatory: Column name “Name”: name of the element, same spelling as in the Simulink model (Shown in EHB tables as column: NAME) Optional: Column name “Description”: explaining text of the element (Shown in EHB tables as column: LONG NAME) Optional: Column name “Access”: Access type of the element, any text allowed (Shown in EHB tables as column: ACCESS) Optional: Column name “ParentName”: Name of parent element of a complex data type e.g. a structure. Any text allowed Xref Name ParentName LOC Sensor LOC Sensor.Value Sensor LOC Sensor.Qualifier Sensor If column is missing, default ‘-‘ is shown in EHB tables All column heading strings and Xref values above must be written exactly as specified. Upper/lower case is not considered. Sequence of column headings is flexible. Optional: All further columns in XLSX are also read and shown in label pop-up and search proposal dialog in EHB-NAV as property –value table, see below. Column heading strings and column content is flexible and shown as it is in same order as in XLSX. First column with empty heading defines end of xls-table.

Compatibility of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR with MDA: The following table shows the compatibility details of connecting EHANDBOOKNAVIGATOR to MDA. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 11.0-12.1 10.0-10.3 9.0-9.3 MDA 8 8.6 Yes Yes Yes 8.5 Yes Yes Yes 8.4 Yes Yes Yes 8.2 No No No The scenarios listed below are considered while connecting from MDA 8 to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR: If no instance of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is running, then the highest version of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is started. It prompts you to select the corresponding documentation file (*.ehb) for the currently loaded measurement file in MDA 8. The loaded EHANDBOOK file name is taken from the running instance and used to preset the file selection. But, it’s possible to choose a different EHANDBOOK file before connecting. If the multiple instances of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR are running, then it connects to the highest version of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. It is also possible to reconnect it if it was disconnected. When an engineer loads the measurement file and connect to EHANDBOOK, he can view/inspect the results in both the EHANDBOOK and MDA 8 Products. The advantages are listed below: In MDA 8: shows the change of signal values over time in the oscilloscope easy zoom-in or zoom-out the oscilloscope easy moving forth and back in time two cursors are now available for offline measurement. Associated measurement values are prefixed with A or B to show to which cursor they belong. When EHANDBOOK is connected, it is possible to request to show the documentation of a signal in MDA 8. The signal name is searched in the currently loaded EHANDBOOK files. In EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR: shows values for a single point in time shows the interdependency of signals in interactive models (how the values are created) The signals were recorded during a test drive (e.g. with INCA) and the recorded values are now to be checked for correct/expected signal values over time. The engineer loads the recording (e.g. a measurement file of *.mf4 format) into MDA 8 and adds some signals to an oscilloscope for inspection. If some values do not have the expected value pattern or exceed certain limits, then engineer wants to check with the documentation for the cause. So he connects with EHANDBOOK and selects the corresponding documentation file (*.ehb) for the currently loaded measurement file. Automatically the corresponding document in the EHANDBOOK is looked up. This describes how to visualize the signal values over time in MDA 8 and look up the related data in the corresponding documentation in EHANDBOOK. Launch MDA 8 Product and load the measurement file in it. Add the signals from the file to an oscilloscope. Click button in the toolbar. Connect to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR dialog box is loaded with the selected documentation file (*.ehb) and measurement (*.mf4) file. If it is not selected, click Browse to select the *.ehb which needs to be selected first time. But in future, all the further connect actions will remember the previously selected documentation file. Click Connect to connect it. The Connect button is enabled only when the measurement file is loaded. Measurement and Calibration Files dialog box is displayed in EHANDBOOK for confirmation. Click Load. The corresponding documentation is loaded in the EHANDBOOK. A calibration engineer navigates to the right topic and opens the interactive model containing the signals under investigation. There, values can be added to the model in which he/she is interested to investigate. Now in MDA 8, you can add the two cursors (Cursor A and Cursor B) for offline measurement. The associated measurements values are prefixed with \"A:\" and \"B\" to show to which cursor they belong to. Click Add Cursors to add the new cursors to the oscilloscope to mark the points in time. Here is a side-by-side view of both the products. Right side view is the EHANDBOOK which shows the documentation where left side view is the MDA 8 which shows the value over time. Right click on any of the cursors to send the exact point in time to the EHANDBOOK. A context menu is displayed. Click Send Time to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. The values are sent to EHANDBOOK. This time value is taken over and is used to display the values for all marked label names. It displays the \"Time range\", \"Cursor A\", \"Cursor B\", and then \"Step by\" values. The time value is given in seconds. When you send a point in time of a MDA 8 cursor to the connected EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, the value is automatically assigned to Cursor A. When you connect EHANDBOOK, it is possible to request to open the documentation of a signal in the currently loaded documentation in MDA 8. Right-click on a signal and click Open Signal Documentation in the context menu to display the signal documentation. When you click on this feature, it searches in all loaded EHANDBOOK files for that particular signal and displays all the occurrences in the \"Search Results\" view in EHANDBOOK. Now, you can find and double-click on it to open from the \"Search Results\" view. This helps to focus on the value and the documentation simultaneously. Replace measurement file feature in the MDA 8 helps to replace a measurement file (*.dat/*.mf3/*.mf4 file) in the MDA 8 and the replaced file will also be updated in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR also. User scenario: The example below describes the user scenario how this feature useful for a calibration engineer. For example, the calibration engineer starts the measurement with the recordings and connects to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Then, the engineer wants to check the recordings on the next day. He replaces the measurement file with the latest recordings by using Replace measurement file feature in the MDA 8. The new measurement file is updated on the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR also without asking the confirmation. When a new measurement file is replaced in the MDA 8, the following changes are also performed in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. All label values are removed Both the cursors are cleared The new time range is calculated The engineer has to click on Display all values to add the values back to the interactive models. To replace a measurement file: Load the measurement file in MDA 8 and click button in the toolbar to connect to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Connect to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR dialog box is loaded with the selected documentation file (*.ehb) and measurement file (*.dat/*.mf3/*.mf4 file). Click Connect to connect it. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is connected with the loaded measurement file for the selected project with all the values. Go to File Explorer in the MDA 8, select the measurement file (*.dat/*.mf3/*.mf4 file). Now, click icon to Replace the measurement file. Windows Explorer is displayed to select the new file for replacement. Select the new measurement file and click Open. The file is replaced in MDA 8 and the same is updated in the EHANDBOOKNAVIGATOR also. The changes reflected in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR after the replacement of the new measurement file are: In the Measurement and Calibration Files dialog box and can be seen when you open it from the Data menu. All label values are removed and both the cursors (Cursor A & Cursor B) are cleared. The new time range is calculated. The button will disconnect the connection between MDA 8 and EHANDBOOK without terminating the running instance of EHANDBOOK. Exiting MDA 8 or EHANDBOOK product will disconnect implicitly.","title":"Interoperability with  MDA 8","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"MDA8","url":"/ehandbook/tutorials-nav/MDA8.html","titles":[{"text":"Use case for the Engineer","hash":"_use_case_for_the_engineer","id":1},{"text":"Loading Documentation from MDA 8","hash":"_loading_documentation_from_mda_8","id":2},{"text":"Loading the Measurement Data Manually","hash":"_loading_the_measurement_data_manually","id":3},{"text":"Replacing Measurement File","hash":"_replacing_measurement_file","id":4},{"text":"Terminating an instance of EHANDBOOK","hash":"_terminating_an_instance_of_ehandbook","id":5}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to determine dependencies between inputs and outputs of functions, calibration parameters and measurement variables. The service works for ASCET block diagram models, Simulink models, C-Code derived models and wherever applicable it works across the hierarchy levels as well (i.e., connections in a sub-hierarchy are followed if it is a block diagram). Both highlighting and hiding of blocks and connections are supported. Highlighted blocks and connections are displayed in red, whereas hidden blocks and connections are displayed in gray. Furthermore, Dependency Analysis Service works in both forwards and backwards direction, depending on whether an input or an output port of the block is selected as shown in the image below. The Dependency Analysis Service provides improved readability and assists you in obtaining a better understanding of dependencies in function models. Using this feature, it is possible to find Measurement variables that are influenced by certain calibration parameters, constants or system constants. Calibration parameters, constants or system constants that influence a certain measurement variable. Either an input or an output of a block can be highlighted or hidden in a single instance. Selection of multiple blocks or multiple inputs/outputs in a single instance is not possible. Multiple instances of highlighting and hiding on the same block are permitted. Dependency Analysis Service is a visual aid. It does not influence the functioning of the model. Highlighted elements Hidden elements If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, only a dummy interactive model is available for performing dependency analysis. There are four tasks that enable you to analyze the dependencies. They are: Highlighting/hiding elements connected to the inputs of a block. Highlighting/hiding elements connected to the outputs of a block. Highlighting/hiding elements connected to the port labels. Remove highlighting/hiding of blocks/labels. Input port selected Context menu Highlighting or hiding the inputs of a block allows you to understand which other blocks, such as calibration parameters, constants and system constants, influence that block.

In C-code based interactive models, signal and control flow highlighting can be performed in forward and backward directions. To highlight the signal flow for inputs in c-code based interactive models, rightclick on the required entity and then select Highlight inputs and click Signal flow based on your requirement. The highlighting of signals is color coded. The entities/ports/connections which are impacting are highlighted in red, by default. Similarly, to highlight the signal flow for outputs, right-click on the required entity and then select Highlight outputs and click Signal flow. The entities/ ports/connections which are impacted are highlighted. The image below displays the entities/ports/connections which are impacting the selected entity are highlighted. The same can be performed for highlighting the Signal flow and control flow where it highlights for both the signal flow and the control flow path which are impacting or impacted by the entity, based on the inputs/outputs selected. Signal and control flow highlighting cannot be triggered for hierarchy connectors. Signal Flow Highlighting for C-code based interactive models is not supported in Basic Mode of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. This feature highlights the lines, connected edges in Red color based on the selection in the interactive models (ASCET, Simulink, and C-code models) and Function Overview diagrams. This feature helps you to know the end to end connections for the selected line/edge. When a user clicks on a line/edge, the clicked line is highlighted in Red color. If the user clicks on a junction point, all the connected edges and lines are highlighted. When the user clicks on another line/edge/junction point, the previously highlighted line/edge/junction point is deselected. This feature works even for Virtual connections and all edges/lines highlighting. Models with Module Methods Navigation and exploration of ASCET based interactive models with module methods supports all operations with respect to expandable entities such as Navigate- in, Navigate-out, Model Exploration and so on. Module methods are also known as self classes in ASCET based interactive models. On expanding a self class, it generates imported, arguments, exported and return connections. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, then a dummy model is displayed in Model Viewer. The same dummy model is displayed whenever you try to access a model in Basic Mode. Earlier to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 5.0, you could able to view the Function Overview diagram or Interactive models in a different window. Now EHANDBOOKNAVIGATOR supports to navigate from Function Overview to Interactive models in the same window through Seamless function wallpaper. It helps to make the connections for Function Overviews and Function Specifications (ASCET/Simulink) or Function Implementation (C-Code) continuously which means that you can navigate in the function wallpaper by means of connections from Function Overviews to Function Specifications (ASCET/Simulink)/Function Implementation (C-Code) or vice-versa in a single window. The Seamless function wallpaper operation can be done by expanding the icon which is available at the top left corner of every Function Overview block or the Function Specifications (ASCET/Simulink) or Function Implementation (C-Code) block. It is also possible to navigate in a seamless function wallpaper via click navigation, i.e. Navigate in and Navigate out.

It also highlights/hides the ports, if they are impacted.","title":"Dependency Analysis","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"dependency_analysis","url":"/ehandbook/tutorials-nav/dependency_analysis.html","titles":[{"text":"Highlighting/Hiding Inputs of a Block","hash":"_highlightinghiding_inputs_of_a_block","id":1},{"text":"Highlighting/Hiding Outputs of a Block","hash":"_highlightinghiding_outputs_of_a_block","id":2},{"text":"Highlighting or Hiding Elements Connected to the Port Labels","hash":"_highlighting_or_hiding_elements_connected_to_the_port_labels","id":3},{"text":"Remove Highlighting or Hiding of Elements","hash":"_remove_highlighting_or_hiding_of_elements","id":4},{"text":"Cease of Signal Flow Highlighting or Hiding","hash":"_cease_of_signal_flow_highlighting_or_hiding","id":5},{"text":"Changing the Color of Signal Flow Highlighting or Hiding","hash":"_changing_the_color_of_signal_flow_highlighting_or_hiding","id":6},{"text":"Propagation of the Signal Flow Highlighting or Hiding for Unknown Blocks","hash":"_propagation_of_the_signal_flow_highlighting_or_hiding_for_unknown_blocks","id":7},{"text":"Signal Flow Highlighting for C-code Based Interactive Models","hash":"_signal_flow_highlighting_for_c_code_based_interactive_models","id":8},{"text":"Highlighting of Connections in Interactive Models and Function Overview Diagrams","hash":"_highlighting_of_connections_in_interactive_models_and_function_overview_diagrams","id":9},{"text":"Navigation and Exploration of ASCET Based Interactive","hash":"_navigation_and_exploration_of_ascet_based_interactive","id":10},{"text":"Seamless Function Wallpaper Operation","hash":"_seamless_function_wallpaper_operation","id":11},{"text":"Viewing the Function Overview Diagram Through an Interactive Model","hash":"_viewing_the_function_overview_diagram_through_an_interactive_model","id":12},{"text":"Signal Flow Highlighting or Hiding in the Seamless Function Wallpaper","hash":"_signal_flow_highlighting_or_hiding_in_the_seamless_function_wallpaper","id":13}]},"60":{"id":60,"text":"The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports linking of the documentation either to a single device or multiple devices. This is needed while handling the visualization of the labels and values coming from INCA or from a measurement and calibration file. When a single EHANDBOOK file (container) is loaded, you can decide which device should be connected to look for a value (one to one mapping). In case of an EHANDBOOK project which contains multiple containers, then you need to decide which file needs to be connected to which device (many to many mappings if multiple devices connected or many to one if a single device connected). For example, if you combine the engine documentation and the gearbox documentation as both measure the engine speed but with the different devices. In this case, single device approach fails because either the value in the engine documentation is right, but for the gearbox value is wrong or vice versa. With the multiple devices setup, you can select the right devices for the engine documentation as well as the gearbox documentation.

EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports connectivity for INCA V7. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, connectivity for INCA is not supported. Compatibility of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR with INCA: The following table shows the compatibility details of connecting EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to INCA. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR 11.0-12.1 10.0-10.3 9.0-9.3 INCA 7.2 Yes Yes Yes 7.3 Yes Yes Yes 7.4 Yes Yes Yes NOTICE The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR may display erroneous values in an interactive model when the real time data will be retrieved from an INCA experiment! Affected values of the interactive model can be displayed erroneous in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR when the content of the A2L file (*.a2l) and the HEX file (*.hex) used in the INCA experiment do not match to the content of the files used in the container. The following real time values can be affected: measuring variables calibration parameters system constants Therefore, always check the conformity of the A2L-file and the HEX-file used in the container and in the INCA experiment (e.g. with the checksum) before you start working. Connecting to an INCA experiment is the first step in establishing a link with an INCA experiment and acquiring values for measurement variables and calibration parameters from the experiment. Prior to connect the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to an INCA experiment, you must first: Start ETAS INCA Select an active workspace Start an INCA experiment Open an interactive model in the Model Viewer Enable the Measurement of Calibrations if you want to add the calibration values. Refer to Enable the Measurement of Calibration values below. It is necessary to make the settings manually before connecting to INCA if you want to visualize the calibration values. If it is set to \"No\", then you will not be able to add values. Changing the user settings on the \"Experiment\" tab does not affect on the already opened experiment. It is necessary to make the settings and reopen the experiment again. If you just reconnect, it is not possible to visualize the calibration values for the experiment which was opened earlier. To perform the settings in INCA: Go to Options menu and click User Options in INCA. Switch to the tab Experiment → General. Set the value to \"Yes\" on the \"Enable Measurement of Calibrations\" option. Close and reopen the INCA experiment. With INCA V7.4.7 a new user option for the rendering of indexed variables was introduced. It controls whether an indexed variable name contains an underscore character in front of the index or not, e.g. indexedVariable_[0] or indexedVariable[0]. On connecting EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to INCA the new user option is automatically queried and used for the correct naming schema. No manual interaction is required. Observe your current user option settings in INCA here: Previous versions of INCA not having this user option will be treated as having the underscore being applied. It is your responsibility to set up a suitable INCA workspace and experiment. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR establishes a connection to the selected workspace and experiment. A single connection established with INCA is applicable for all the interactive models displayed in multiple Model Viewers. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR running in Basic Mode does not support connectivity for INCA. To connect to an INCA experiment: Go to Data menu and select INCA Experiment (Live). Select INCA Experiment (Live) in the Data Source drop-down menu on the status bar. INCA Experiment (Live) dialog box is displayed with appropriate information. If all the above Prerequisites are satisfied, then the image which is shown below is displayed. Then the connection is established with INCA. If the connection is not established, an error message(s) with appropriate instructions are shown. Checkbox for comparison of case sensitive label name Checkbox for displaying existing variables values If an INCA experiment has few thousands of labels, the model navigation (incase of deeply nested hierarchy) is faster if the check box is checked. It will be much slower for the same model, if the checkbox is unselected. If the “Read only mode\" checkbox is checked then only those variable values configured in the connected INCA experiment are displayed. In case the variable is indexed then only those indices will be used. If the \"Read only mode\" checkbox is unchecked, all variable values are displayed and also allows to add new variable(s) to the INCA experiment. If there are indices available already in the INCA experiment then those indices are used. In case the variable is not available, then the associated variable gets added with zero index (\"_[0]\") as default. The indexed labels are displayed as a table as shown below. Click Connect to connect with INCA. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, connectivity for INCA is not supported. The calibration values will be displayed in the read-only mode only when INCA 7.3.6 or newer versions is connected. Before starting the visualization of measurement variables and calibration parameters, the model blocks representing measurement variables and calibration parameters must be configured to show/hide values. You have the option of configuring a single block at a time or configuring all the blocks that are visible in the interactive model, displayed in the Model Viewer. The model blocks must be configured only after a connection has been established with an INCA experiment. On configuring the model blocks, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR interacts with the INCA experiment and identifies for which blocks, the values can be displayed. If values can be displayed for a block, '-' is displayed below the block and a value is displayed in the brackets after starting the visualization. To display values of measurement variables and/or calibration parameters, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR automatically adds instruments to the active layer in the INCA experiment. You have to create and/or select a layer in the INCA experiment to which the instruments shall be added. When EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR adds instruments to a layer, measurement variables are added to the pre-configured default measurement raster. The default measurement raster has to be pre-configured in the A2L file. Once the visualization has been started, then it is possible to add values as the application automatically stops the experiment at the values and starts the experiment again. It is possible to configure model blocks only after you have connected EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR with an INCA experiment. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, connectivity for INCA is not supported. To configure a single measurement variable or calibration parameter to show/hide value: Right-click on the measurement variable or calibration parameter block you want to configure. A context menu is displayed. Select Display Value to configure the block to display the value of the measurement variable or calibration parameter. Select Hide Value to configure the block to hide the value of the measurement variable or calibration parameter. To configure all the blocks, visible in the interactive model displayed in the Model Viewer, to show values: Click Display all values in the Status bar. Go to Data menu, select Display all Values. Press . To configure all the blocks, visible in the interactive model displayed in the Model Viewer, to hide values: Click Hide all values in the Status bar. Go to Data menu, select Hide all Values. Press . Start Visualization feature in Data Menu Start Visualization button in the Status bar Starting the visualization and stopping the measurement of an INCA experiment using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is supported. Model blocks must be configured before starting the visualization. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, connectivity for INCA is not supported. To start the visualization: Click Start Visualization (2) in the Status bar. In the Data menu, select Start Visualization. Press F11. Visualization of the connected INCA experiment is started and values for the configured blocks are being displayed and periodically updated. Values for measurement variables are updated at a different rate in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR when compared to the INCA experiment. The update rate allows identification of changes in values over a period of time. Values are not updated in real-time and might not reflect the actual value at a certain point in time. If you configure blocks of interactive models in multiple Model Viewers, visualization of values occurs simultaneously in all the loaded interactive models. Stop Measurement in Data Menu Stop Measurement button in the Status bar It is possible to stop the measurement of the INCA experiment only if the visualization has started. To stop the measurement: Click Stop Measurement (2) in the Status bar. In the Data menu, select Stop Measurement (1). Press F9. The latest values measured in the INCA experiment is displayed in the Model Viewer. If a recording is additionally running in the connected INCA experiment, you receive a notification to proceed or stop the running experiment and measurement. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports live visualization of output values for maps and curves from a connected INCA experiment. Before starting the visualization of measurement variables and calibration parameters, the default measurement raster has to be preconfigured in the A2L file. Before starting the visualization of measurement variables and calibration parameters, the model blocks representing measurement variables and calibration parameters must be configured to Display/Hide values. The model blocks must be configured only after a connection has been established with an INCA experiment EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports displaying of values in decimal points also. The value format of a label displayed in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR from a connected INCA experiment comprises of the following criteria: If a COMPU_METHOD is defined for a label then the format which is defined in the compuMethod will be applied. If a COMPU_METHOD is not available, then INCA by default defines two decimal places for the label and passes it to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Rounding off the decimal values happens at the last digit after the decimal point. The values are Round up or Round down based on the value of the last digit. For example, 6.737 is rounded up to 6.74 and value 6.734 is rounded down to 6.73. There are chances that the output data may not be displayed, if input data is not specified or if there is some issue with the INCA experiment. If no output value is displayed for a map or curve, please check the input data and also check the INCA experiment. Values for measurement variables are updated at a different rate in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR when compared to the INCA experiment. The update rate allows identification of changes in values over a period of time. Values are not updated in real-time and might not reflect the actual value at a certain point in time. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to add the labels to an interactive model even if no hardware is connected to INCA. You can load an Experiment in your system and make sure that workspace is active. After making the connection, you can add a valid label which is just below the label in the interactive model of an EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. This valid label which is known to INCA and that can be added to the interactive model in the Experiment. It helps you to prepare the initial setup at your desk even if no hardware is connected to INCA. At the later stage, once the setup is ready, then you can connect your system to hardware device when it is available, and execute the experiments. To add the labels, follow the steps below: Click Connect to INCA Experiment in the Connectivity View. In the Connectivity menu, select Connect to INCA Experiment. Refer to Connecting to INCA Experiment for more details. Open an Interactive model, select the label which you want to add it for experimentation ( Refer to Configuring Model Blocks to Show/Hide Values for more details on configuring the values), and rightclick. A context menu is displayed. Click Display Value. A valid label which is known to INCA is marked with just below the label. It is important that you can start the experiment only with the proper hardware device is connected. As soon as you connect the hardware to INCA and start the experiment, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR checks the active device and executes the experiment. A new variable when added via the Display Value or Display all Values is checked if it is configured in the connected INCA experiment. In case the variables is not configured then only those variables are added and displayed in the Tool API window. It is possible to disconnect from an INCA experiment to which EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR has already established a connection. To stop the running INCA experiment: Go to Data menu and select None. Select None in the Data Source drop-down menu on the Status bar. When the other data source is connected in EHANDBOOK, the connection with INCA as well as the labels which were already added will be removed.","title":"Interoperability with ETAS INCA","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"interoperability_with_ETAS_INCA","url":"/ehandbook/tutorials-nav/interoperability_with_ETAS_INCA.html","titles":[{"text":"Connecting to INCA Experiment","hash":"_connecting_to_inca_experiment","id":1},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":2},{"text":"Enable the Measurement of Calibration values","hash":"_enable_the_measurement_of_calibration_values","id":3},{"text":"Configuring Model Blocks to Show/Hide Values","hash":"_configuring_model_blocks_to_showhide_values","id":4},{"text":"Starting the Visualization","hash":"_starting_the_visualization","id":5},{"text":"Stopping the Measurement","hash":"_stopping_the_measurement","id":6},{"text":"Live Visualization of Output Values for Maps and Curves","hash":"_live_visualization_of_output_values_for_maps_and_curves","id":7},{"text":"Adding Labels when Hardware Device is Inactive","hash":"_adding_labels_when_hardware_device_is_inactive","id":8},{"text":"Stopping the Running INCA Experiment","hash":"_stopping_the_running_inca_experiment","id":9}]},"64":{"id":64,"text":"EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR has the capability to establish a connection with a running CANape application and provides a closer link between models representing the functions and the measurement values obtained during the calibration procedure. This feature provides an integrated view on the algorithm specifications of a function (ASCET/SIMULINK model diagram) and the values being measured in the CANape application. The values from a running CANape application for measurement variables are displayed directly in the interactive model within the Model Viewer of the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. It is also possible to configure which of the measurement variables depicted in the interactive model, should display the values. Starting the measurement and stopping the measurement of the connected CANape application directly from the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is also supported. This feature provides support only for Read-only mode i.e. the display of measurement value is possible only for variables already selected in the CANape application. It is not possible to add new variables from EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to the CANape application. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports connectivity for CANape V21.0. Currently we don’t support the full functionality of what CANape offers. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode (EHANDBOOK_NAVIGATOR_BASIC) or in Full Mode (EHANDBOOK_NAVIGATOR), connectivity for CANape is not supported. In order to use this feature, you need to procure an additional Add-on license (EHANDBOOK_NAVIGATOR_CANAPE). Please look at ETAS Contacts on how to get an evaluation license or purchase a license. Compatibility of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR with CANape: EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR V12.0 is compatible with CANape V21.0. NOTICE The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR may display erroneous values in an interactive model when the real time data will be retrieved from a CANape project! The real time measurement variables can be affected. The correctness of the displayed value for measurement data has to be verified using a suitable tool. The user is responsible for correctly assigning EHB containers to corresponding hardware devices. Connecting to a running CANape application and loaded CANape project is the first step in establishing a link with a CANape application and acquiring values for measurement variables from the project. Prior to connect the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR to a CANape application, you must first: Start Vector CANape application Create/Load a project Create/Load a configuration Switch to ASAP3 mode in CANape. Don’t disconnect from ASAP3 mode until there is an active connection with EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. On EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, load a corresponding container and open an interactive model in the Model Viewer It is your responsibility to set up a suitable CANape project and application. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR establishes a connection to the selected project workspace and application. A single connection established with CANape is applicable for all the interactive models displayed in multiple Model Viewers. To connect to an existing CANape application: Go to Data menu and select CANape (Live). Select CANape (Live) in the Data Source drop-down menu on the status bar. CANape (Live) dialog box is displayed with appropriate information. If all the above Prerequisites are satisfied, then the image which is shown below is displayed. Then the connection is established with CANape. If the connection is not established, an error message(s) with appropriate instructions are shown. Click Connect to connect with CANape. If connection is successfully established, a windows notification message pops up on right bottom side of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, connectivity for CANape is not supported. The calibration values will not be displayed when CANape is connected. Before starting the visualization of measurement variables, the model blocks representing measurement variables must be configured to display/hide values. You have the option of configuring a single block at a time or configuring all the blocks that are visible in the interactive model, displayed in the Model Viewer. This can be done through either the Display Value context menu option for individual variable or the Display all values button available in the status bar. The model blocks must be configured only after a connection has been established with CANape application. On configuring the model blocks, EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR interacts with the CANape application and identifies for which blocks, the values can be displayed. If values can be displayed for a block, '-' is displayed below the block and a value is displayed in the brackets after starting the visualization. It is possible to configure model blocks only after you have connected EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR with a CANape application. If you are using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR in Basic Mode, connectivity for CANape is not supported. To configure a single measurement variable to display/hide value: Right-click on the measurement variable you want to configure. A context menu is displayed. Select Display Value to configure the block to display the value of the measurement variable. Select Hide Value to configure the block to hide the value of the measurement variable. To configure all the blocks, visible in the interactive model displayed in the Model Viewer, to show values: Click Display all values in the Status bar. Go to Data menu, select Display all Values. Press . To configure all the blocks, visible in the interactive model displayed in the Model Viewer, to hide values: Click Hide all values in the Status bar. Go to Data menu, select Hide all Values. Press . Start Visualization feature in Data Menu Start Visualization button in the Status bar Starting the visualization and stopping the measurement of CANape application using EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is supported.

To start the visualization: Click Start Visualization (2) in the Status bar. In the Data menu, select Start Visualization. Press F11. Visualization of the connected CANape application is started and values for the configured blocks are being displayed and periodically updated. Values for measurement variables are updated at a different rate in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR when compared to the CANape application. The update rate allows identification of changes in values over a period of time. Values are not updated in real-time and might not reflect the actual value at a certain point in time. If you configure blocks of interactive models in multiple Model Viewers, visualization of values occurs simultaneously in all the loaded interactive models. Stop Measurement in Data Menu Stop Measurement button in the Status bar It is possible to stop the measurement of the CANape application only if the visualization has started. To stop the measurement: Click Stop Measurement (2) in the Status bar. In the Data menu, select Stop Measurement (1). Press F9. The latest values measured in the CANape application is displayed in the Model Viewer. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports displaying of values in decimal points. The value format of a label displayed in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR from a connected CANape application comprises of the following criteria: CANape application passes on the decimal value to EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR which is displayed as it is. Rounding off the decimal values happens at the last digit after the decimal point. The values are Round up or Round down based on the value of the last digit. For example, 6.737 is rounded up to 6.74 and value 6.734 is rounded down to 6.73. There is additionally an option to remove the trailing zeroes from the received value. It is possible to disconnect from the CANape application to which EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR has already established a connection. It will also switch off the ASAP3(remote) mode in CANape.

This is the new scenario where EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR supports with the MCD here. Compared to the live visualization where time moves forward at a constant pace (a sample is taken every 250 ms), the offline visualization allows the calibration engineer to move back, finds a value being out of range/too high/too low and investigate the cause. Either engineer can fix it by adjusting some calibration value (or even report a bug to the developer of the ECU software). A Data Source provides values for names/labels in interactive models. Switching between different Data Sources will remove already added values from all the interactive models. The newly added functionality in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is the Measurement and Calibration Files. It allows the visualization of values which are recorded previously. For example, with INCA. Measurement and calibration values for the labels related to ASCET 6 record type blocks are displayed as shown below. The value format of a label displayed in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR using Measurement and Calibration Files comprises of the following criteria: If the FORMAT is attached to a label in an A2L file, then by default the defined format value is applied. If FORMAT is not available but COMPU_METHOD is defined, then the format that is defined in the mentioned compuMethod will be applied. If there is neither FORMAT nor COMPU_METHOD available, the user defined format in the Preferences dialog box on the Data Visualization tab is used.

No manual settings required. The numeric values that are found in the measurement files are replaced by their corresponding textual entries in the COMPU_VTAB. If no value is available, for example, when no value has been recorded up to the current cursor position, the text \"n/a\" is displayed. It is also possible to remove a single value. Right-click on a label in an interactive model to hide a value. A context menu is displayed. Click Hide Value. Hide Value. For measurement values, values are displayed if they are recorded before. In some cases, few label names will not have a value recorded. In the current implementation, the values for the System Constants are not shown. In such cases, when you right-click on a value, the context menu displays only the disabled state of Display Value (Not available in current data source) or (or in the currently selected device, but the long text would not fit into the context menu). In such cases, a new recording is required. Display all measurement and calibration values and Hide all measurement and calibration values allow to add values to all known labels and to remove all label from the currently active interactive model. No extra message is shown if few of the labels or all labels do not have values. After adding at least one value, the time field and the navigation buttons become enabled. Automatically, the time of the first sample is shown which may not be zero as expected. A new time may be entered in seconds with fraction and the value is updated to the time of the next measurement sample after this point in time. There is only one time value for all inter- active models. So changing it in one model changes the time for all models and therefore the values. When you expand a block by clicking icon on an interactive model, all label names that already have a value assigned, also get updated with values automatically. Here the labels in the above example have a value. Labels inside a box never show values as the box is quite full already. But, when you expand the box or interactive model, all labels get a value assigned if a value is already known. This saves your time to add labels again which you are interested in. This happens even if you close the interactive model and open the same or another interactive model. For all known labels, the value get updated automatically. The forward navigation button ( ), backward navigation button ( ) allow to step ONE sample forward and backward respectively in time. This is not intended as a way to move in time. The functionality of the Set as Reference (for previous / next values) is to step the next/previous value sample buttons. Without a reference, the time is increased to the time next value sample. With the reference set on a label, the time is increased/decreased until the value of the label changes. This can be 50 milliseconds or 500 seconds. Only one label can be used as a reference at a time. When you click on Set as Reference (for previous/next values), the referenced label will be highlighted with green. Selecting a different label will replace the existing reference. You can clear the reference variable by clicking on Clear Reference. NOTICE The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR may display wrong measurement values in the interactive model. Affected values of the interactive model can be displayed erroneous in the interactive model when the wrong measurement file is chosen or because of display errors. Therefore, always check the conformity of the displayed measurement values with a suitable tool for measurement data analysis. NOTICE The EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR may display erroneous information and data of the application labels. Affected information and values, especially calibration parameters, can be displayed erroneous in the EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR when the content of the EHANDBOOK container or project does not match to the content of the input data. The following formats are concerned: A2L HEX S19 DCM CDF PaCo MDF Therefore, always check the conformity of the files used in the container and project before you start working. When you are working with the interactive models, you can add the labels only for the highlighted signals. This helps to visualize only the right labels which are needed for you. To display the values for the labels on highlighted paths: Connect to an INCA experiment Connecting to INCA Experiment or load the Measurement and Calibration files Visualize offline measurement. Highlight an input block or output block Highlighting/Hiding Inputs of a Block or Highlighting/Hiding Outputs of a Block. Go to Data menu and click Display all Values on Highlighted Paths.

This label name could be a short name or a Display Identifier. When the Display Identifier is used in an EHANDBOOK Container and you load a matching A2L file, then the Label Pop-up displays the short name in the title. The Display Identifier is shown separately in the properties. In general, the short and long name is a term in the ASAM standards: short name: The label name which is displayed long name: The description of a label Display Identifier: The alias name of a label, this could be shown instead of a short name Name of the label Display Identifier When you search for the label in all Find in EHANDBOOK File(s)and if the Display Identifier of a label is available, then search hit displays both the entries (the long name and the short name) in the Search Result View. In few specific cases, the Label Pop-up displays the Display Identifier in the title as main label name instead of the long name. The long name is displayed in the \"Name\" field inside the Label Pop-up. When you search a label by specifying the long name in the Find in EHANDBOOK File(s), EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR displays the result for long names as well. The conversion property shows the COMPU_METHOD associated with the label. The types of COMPU_METHOD table are: COMPU_TAB COMPU_VTAB COMPU_VTAB_RANGE If there is no mapping table available, then only compuMethod name is displayed. COMPU_TAB The COMPU_TAB is a mapping between two numbers. Conversion Show mapping values Back to overview COMPU_VTAB The COMPU_VTAB is a mapping between number and a string.

Importing Functions Exporting Functions Function Overview Diagram feature in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR assists you in obtaining an overview between function components (FCs). ECU software function components are dependent on each other. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR allows you to trace the communication occurring between functions. The icon is available at the top left corner of every Function Overview Diagram if the corresponding function belongs to ASCET or Simulink or C_CODE based models. It helps to make the connections seamlessly in a single window for Function Overviews and Function Specifications (ASCET/Simulink) or Function Implementation (C-Code). In the function overview diagram the importing functions (1) are displayed on the left and the exported functions (2) are displayed on the right. Press F3 to initiate a Find in current tab in the function overview diagram. When a label is selected, the properties of the label are displayed in the Properties View. Make sure that high screen resolution setting is enabled during installation to view the Model Viewer and the Function Overview Diagrams properly.

The same dummy Function Overview diagram is displayed whenever you try to access a Function Overview diagram. In AUTOSAR (Classic) based ECU software, the algorithms of the ECU functions are represented by software components. These software components can have ports of different interface types (e.g., Sender/Receiver or Client/Server). The interfaces which type the ports can have additional entries (e.g., Data Elements as part of the Sender/Receiver interface). To establish communication, the ports must be connected via connectors. When an EHANDBOOK Container contains component information that was based on AUTOSAR (Classic), the dependency between the components can be shown in the overview diagrams. The communication between components is based on AUTOSAR ports and their connections. To show the ports between components and their dependencies, the AUTOSAR (Classic) Add-On for EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR is required. The ports in the Function Overview Diagrams are color coded. This helps you in identifying if the ports have any further connections or not. The connected ports are displayed in Red and non-connected ports are displayed in Grey.

This replaces the previously used multiple PDF documents. With the new web-based documentation, all contents can be searched and navigated seamlessly. Furthermore, the content has been enhanced with a set of Tutorials. For an overview, see the Welcome page. The blocks in Simulink models automatically are assigned with coordinates for their placement on the canvas. When the canvas is panned and new blocks are added, it can happen that the coordinates have negative values. When converting Simulink models with negative coordinates to interactive models, in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR this has lead to overlaps, e.g. when a function overview block is expanded. With EHANDBOOK 10.3, negative coordintates are handled by introducing an automatic offset to the coordinates of blocks. This applies to both EHANDBOOK Container-Build as well as EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. In EHANDBOOK 10.2.0 and earlier, the ClickPic feature was not working as expected when using the Unified Graphics Generator (UGG) for pre-generating interactive models and EHANDBOOK Container-Build in combination with intermediate hierarchy filtering concept. Thic scenario is now also supported. EHANDBOOK Container-Build 10.3.0 now supports the conversion of models created with ASCET 6.4.7 to interactive models. This also applies for the EHANDBOOK Container-Build add-on 10.3.0 for ASCET 6. The mask definitions of blocks used in a Simulink model can make use of signals and calibrations defined in an associated data dictionary. When generating EHANDBOOK Containers from Simulink models using the EHANDBOOK Container-Build App for Simulink, the associated data dictionary is now also considered.

A typical characteristic is that they have a colored background, and that they are used as a background for other blocks. So far, area blocks were not yet supported in EHANDBOOK. While annotation blocks were already supported, there where, however, issues with overlapping annotation blocks. With EHANDBOOK 11.0, the Z-order for area and annotation blocks is not evaluated during the conversion to an interactive model. Through this, these blocks can now be properly rendered in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR - even in case of overlaps. Area and annotation blocks are only displayed in default layout. In automatic layout, they are not shown as they might appear in a wrong place. In Simulink models, non-referenced masked blocks can have a block description that can even be customized by the modeler. The block description can contain valuable information to understand the meaning of a block. In EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, the block description is now available as a tooltip upon hovering over the block. To convert and render Simulink models appropriately, EHANDBOOK Container-Build (or UGG) must know the paths to all Simulink libraries that are used by a Simulink model. (For details, refer to How to support Simulink libraries in EHANDBOOK). So far, EHANDBOOK Container-Build provided the CLI option -simlib which required to pass all Simulink library paths as a String. To simplify passing Simulink library paths to EHANDBOOK Container-Build, there is a new CLI option to pass them as a confioguration file in JSON format. For details, refer to CLI options for EHB-CB. Errors and warning messages are now highlighted in color in the console window. Through this, important messages can be identified more easily. Root-level skipping is a feature where the entry level of an ASCET or Simulink-based interactive model is adjusted in such a way that certain unnecessary root-levels are skipped. This feature was supported for the standard EHB-CB approach where ASCET and Simulink models are converted, but not for the incremental EHB-CB approach where pre-generated UGG artifacts are processed. With EHANDBOOK 11.0, root-level skipping is now also supported for pre-generated UGG artifacts.","title":"Version 11.0 (March 2023)","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"version_11_0","url":"/ehandbook/whats-new/version_11_0.html","titles":[{"text":"NAVIGATOR","hash":"navigator","id":1},{"text":"Enhanced Bookmarking Feature","hash":"_enhanced_bookmarking_feature","id":2},{"text":"Container-Build","hash":"container-build","id":3},{"text":"Support for area and annotation blocks","hash":"support-for-sl-area-annotation-blocks","id":4},{"text":"Support for Simulink block descriptions","hash":"support-for-sl-block-descriptions","id":5},{"text":"New CLI option -simlibfile","hash":"new-cli-option-simlibfile","id":6},{"text":"Highlight Error and Warning messages in console window","hash":"highlight-messages-in-console-window","id":7},{"text":"Root-level skipping for UGG generated interactive models","hash":"root-level-skipping-ugg-icb","id":8}]},"84":{"id":84,"text":"Integrate PDF content into your EHANDBOOK Container.

The goal of the partnership is to establish a global standard for common software architecture, application interfaces, and methodology of embedded software for vehicle electronics. AUTOSAR distinguishes two major platforms: 1. Classic Platform for embedded, real-time applications 2. Adaptive Platform for computationally intensive applications ETAS EHANDBOOK currently supports the AUTOSAR (Classic) platform. AUTOSAR (Classic) defines its own software component technology for specifying the application software of embedded control units. The concepts are specified in the AUTOSAR meta-model and described in the Software Component Template (Link). In AUTOSAR (Classic), the application logic is defined in so-called software components. Software components communicate with each other over ports. Ports are typed through interfaces which specify what is communicated between the software components, and how. To establish communication between software components, ports are connected to each other through explicit connectors. To organize the application logic defined in the software components, these can be aggregated to compositions. AUTOSAR application software component technology makes tracing of end-to-end signal flows across ECU software much more complicated to understand. Why is that? In previous concepts prior to the AUTOSAR (Classic) standard, e.g. the ASAM MDX standard, communication between the components of the application software was established through name-based communication: Two functions A and B communicate with each other if function A writes a signal of the same name msg as function B reads. Through global variables (often referred to as messages) in the C-code implementation, an implicit communication was realized. One drawback of global variables is that the collaborating parties have to strictly agree on who defines which variable. This is necessary in order to avoid late problems at integration time. Deducing dependencies between components of the application software purely based on implicit, name-based communication is rather straight forwards: you only have to follow the read/write dependencies. With AUTOSAR (Classic), the problem of collaboration amongst multiple was resolved by introducing a software component technology with rules for interface compatibility and an explicit mechanism for establishing connections between software components. In an AUTOSAR (Classic) based software architecture, software components specify a number of ports which are typed by different kinds of interfaces. Software components need to be instantiated in the context of a composition. In this context, the ports have to be connected explicitly by so-called connectors. The interfaces of the connected ports must be compatible, i.e. fulfill certain rules of interface compatibility. Consequently, in order to deduce a dependency between software components and for example follow a signal flow over multiple software components, it is necessary to infer this information from the software components, and the elements in the interfaces. Analyzing all these details just to find out if and how two software components are connected is challenging as it requires more than checking equivalence of names of global variables. It can also be more tricky and thus error-prone, e.g., a when connector between two compatible ports is missing. With the AUTOSAR (Classic) support in EHANDBOOK, we address these challenges and make the dependencies between software components as easy as possible to follow and understand. With the AUTOSAR (Classic) add-on for EHANDBOOK Container-Build, it is possible to derive the necessary information for AUTOSAR software components, their ports, interfaces and connections from .arxml (AUTOSAR XML) files and store them in EHANDBOOK Container files. With the AUTOSAR (Classic) add-on for EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, users can explore the dependencies between software components which are based on AUTOSAR (Classic) completely seamlessly.","title":"AUTOSAR","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"autosar_classic","url":"/ehandbook/explanations/automotive_standards/autosar_classic.html","titles":[{"text":"AUTOSAR (Classic) Software Component Technology","hash":"_autosar_classic_software_component_technology","id":1},{"text":"Challenges induced by AUTOSAR (Classic)","hash":"_challenges_induced_by_autosar_classic","id":2},{"text":"EHANDBOOK Solution","hash":"_ehandbook_solution","id":3}]},"91":{"id":91,"text":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build supports several automotive standards for structuring input data or providing meta-data for the ECU software architecture and its entities (i.e., software components).

To set up the demo, launch ASCET-DEVELOPER and select a workspace that you want to use. You can use an existing workspace or create a new one. Create a new workspace by going to File -> Switch Workspace -> Other and then specifying a new directory for your workspace. To install the BoardComputer demo app, open the Eclipse Welcome Page via Help -> Welcome and click on samples. On the next page, select the ASCET-DEVELOPER Samples. From the dialog, select the Board Computer app, then press Next and Finish. After the BoardComputer app is installed, you should see a set of projects in the Project Explorer and the main block diagram of the app. Expand the project BoardComputer and the directory components to see the .app file. Then double-click on the BoardComputer.app file. In the corresponding editor, you can see the entry point classes of the app as well as the operating system (OS) schedule that has been configured. It is this BoardComputer.app file which is the starting point for generating an EHANDBOOK Container. To generate an EHANDBOOK container for the BoardComputer app, we need to create a new launch configuration. Go to Run -> Run As -> EHANDBOOK Container-Build …​. In the dialog, we have to configure a few settings: Name: This is the name of the launch configuration. This will also be used for the EHANDBOOK Container file name, i.e. the generated output. ASCET application: Here you can select the ASCET app file for which you want to generate an EHANDBOOK Container. In our case, this is the BoardComputer.app, and it is already pre-selected. Generate results into folder: Here we have to specify a directory where the EHB Container-Build results shall be generated. This can be a location within the workspace or project, or another location on your system. EHB Container-Build Path: Here we have to specify the path to the specific EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool that shall be invoked for generating the EHB Container file. This path must point to the eHandbookCB.exe of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool we installed earlier. Additional Commands: Here you can provide additional command-line parameters to the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool. For the BoardComputer demo app, we will use the -splitapp option. This will generate an EHANDBOOK Container where the entry point classes are represented as individual function building blocks in EHANDBOOK. Furthermore, we will use the -gensvg option. This will generate SVG images for both function overviews as well as block diagram models. The following image shows the dialog filled with the necessary entries. Click on Apply to save the lauch configuration. To trigger an EHANDBOOK Container-Build for the BoardComputer app, click on Run in the launch configuration. You can observe the outputs of the EHANDBOOK Container-Build process in the Console window. After the build has finished, you can find the EHANDBOOK Container file BoardComputer_EHB_Gen.ehb in the previously defined location. After the EHANDBOOK Container file has been generated, let’s inspect it in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. To launch the tool and open the EHANDBOOK Container file, simply double-click on the BoardComputer_EHB_Gen.ehb file. After the EHANDBOOK Container is loaded, you will see the following things in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR: A title page with some information when the EHANDBOOK Container was generated and for which app. In our case, the BoardComputer demo app. (Note that the title page can be fully customized using the optional styling and branding configurations offered by EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools.) A table of contents with all entry point classes of the BoardComputer app, sorted in alphabetic order. Note that these are referred to as functions in EHANDBOOK (i.e., the entry point classes of the ASCET-DEVELOPER app have been converted to functions in EHANDBOOK). For each function, the following entries are available: Function Overview: This section provides a graphical depiction of the function with its inputs and outputs. Systemconstant-Parameter-Variable-Classinstance-Structure: This section provides a set of tables for system constants, parameters, variables and class instances of the function. Note that the tables can be configured via the table configuration feature of EHANDBOOK Container-Build. Function: This entry directly links to the interactive model and opens a model viewer window. Function Overview: This entry directly links to the function overview as interactive model and opens a model viewer window. Expand the entry BoardComputer and click on the entry with the model icon. This will open a new Model Viewer tab in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Note that the entry point class is shown with it’s outer layout first. Double-click onto the block to navigate in. The next level shows the different diagrams that are available for the block diagram specifications. Double-click on the block with _10ms to navigate in. Here, you can see the same block diagram as in ASCET-DEVELOPER - now as interactive model in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Note that when you switch to the Model Explorer view, you can see the full hierarchy of the interactive model, i.e. all diagrasms and all nesting levels of the block diagram. By double-clicking on a specific entry, you can also navigate to a specific location. You can also create function overview diagrams with multiple interconnected functions and trace signals across them. The block diagrams from the static classes are contained within the functions. Through this, you can trace signal flows within and across functions. For more features, such as the connectivity to INCA 7 or MDA 8, check out the videos on the Welcome Page of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR or the EHANDBOOK playlist on the ETAS YouTube channel. EHANDBOOK supports two styles for how to author and interpret documentation contents which are attached to ASCET-DEVELOPER apps. In both approaches, the documentation link files (.dlk) files provided by ASCET-DEVELOPER keep track of the linking between model elements and documentation files. With ASCET-DEVELOPER, you can attach documentation snippets to all kinds of model artifacts such as ESDL files, block diagrams, specifications, containers or statement blocks, and even methods. Through this, small pieces of information are attached to the individual model elements that shall be documented. EHANDBOOK Container-Build can collect all documentation snippets and aggregate them into a single documentation chapter. Furthermore, you can obtain an automatically generated model screenshot which is embedded along with the documentation snippet. In this approach, a single documentation file is attached to the block diagram or ESDL class that represents a static entry point class. The documentation file contains all your contents for the complete static entry point class. As an expert author, you have the complete degree of freedom for how to structure the contents of your documentation chapter. For generating model screenshots which are automatically embedded at the places of your choice, you can add EHANDBOOK-specific ASCIIDoc markers. At first, we need to set up the documentation infrastructure support for the BoardComputer app. This is done by ASCET-DEVELOPER when you try to create a documentation file for an ASCET model element for the first time. Right-click on the BoardComputer.bd file in the Project Explorer and select Linked Documentation -> Create from the menu. As no documentation configuration file is found yet, ASCET-DEVELOPER creates a new one. You can find the documentation.ini file in the project directory of the BoardComputer app. You can inspect the file to learn more about the possible configurations. One additional important step is to manually create the directory where the documentation sources will be managed. This directory is also mentioned in the documentation.ini file. # Description: # The target folder which is used to put in the generated documentation files. # This property is displayed in document dialog. targetRootFolder = ${project_loc}/documentation So let’s go ahead and create the documentation directory. Now that the infrastructure is set up, we can add a documentation to the BoardComputer.bd file. Right-click on the BoardComputer.bd file in the Project Explorer and select Linked Documentation -> Create from the menu. Click on Finish to create the documenation file. ASCET-DEVELOPER then automatically opens the newly created documentation file in the associated editor. Now let’s add some content. Before we start writing, here are some backgrounds on ASCIIDoc, ASCET-DEVELOPER and EHANDBOOK. What is ASCIIDoc? AsciiDoc belongs to the family of lightweight markup languages, the most renowned of which is Markdown. AsciiDoc is two things: A mature[1], plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called backends), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub. ASCET-DEVELOPER supports attaching documentation contents in ASCIIDoc format to ASCET-DEVELOPER artifacts. And EHANDBOOK supports the conversion and aggregation of ASCIIDoc documentation contents - amongst other files and formats - to an interactive documenation in EHANDBOOK format. To learn more about how to author contents in ASCIIDoc format, refer to the ASCIIDoc Syntax Quick Reference. Let’s now add some content to the ASCIIDoc file attached to BoardComputer.bd. You can copy & paste the following content. We’ll go through it step by step below.

It is used to a) create a screenshot of a referred graphical model element (e.g., a block diagram specification, container, etc.) b) create a link of the screenshot to the interactive model in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR ehbmodelref::BoardComputer._10ms[BoardComputer._10ms] ehbmodelref::BoardComputer._10ms.velocity_conversion[BoardComputer._10ms.velocity_conversion] ehbmodelref::BoardComputer._10ms.distance_calculation[BoardComputer._10ms.distance_calculation] ehbmodelref::BoardComputer._10ms.avgspeed_calculation[BoardComputer._10ms.avgspeed_calculation] The syntax is similar to the syntax for embedding an image: image::ascet-developer/vCockpit.png[] Additionally to referencing to models and generating screenshots, you can also include any textual contents within your ASCET-DEVELOPER project using an include directive. #include::../components/BoardComputer.esdl[] Note that the contents of the referred file are simply included without any styling being applied to it. In order to generate screenshots for function overviews and model references, an additional command-line parameter -gensvg has to be added to the launch configuration of EHANDBOOK Container-Build. With these changes, we can now generate an EHANDBOOK Container. When opening the EHANDBOOK Container in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, you can that the textual contents from the ASCIIDoc file are now available within the chapter for the BoardComputer static class entry point class. The navigation structure of the section Documentation is derived from the nesting structure of the sections in the ASCIIDoc file The content is formattted accordording to the markup specified in the ASCIIDoc file At places where an EHANDBOOK model reference has been placed, an auto-generated screenshot from ASCET-DEVELOPER has been included. This screenshot is directly linked with the interactive model hierarchy. The ESDL code which was referred to was directly included in the content. Note that all relevant features of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR also work, such as: Label Popup in the embedded model screenshot is supported Model screenshots that are related to each other are directly interlinked (click on class instances or containers/statement blocks with yellow frame to navigate) While the previously generated EHANDBOOK Container does contain function overviews and interactive models for all the static entry point classes of the BoardComputer app, it does not yet contain any textual documentation. But what is an interactive documentation without any textual documentation? You’re right - only half the truth. To complete the example, we are now attaching some textual contents. Note that EHANDBOOK supports two different styles for how to author documentation content that is attached to ASCET-DEVELOPER apps. Learn more about the two styles in section ASCET-DEVELOPER authoring styles. For the tutorial, we are going to use the expert authoring mode. The rest of the chapter is structured as follows: Setting up the documentation infrastructure Attaching an ASCIIDoc documentation file Writing documentation content in ASCIIDoc Altering the launch configuration Inspecting the EHANDBOOK Container with textual documentation in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR EHANDBOOK Container-Build can generate an additional PDF documentation based on the EHANDBOOK Container contents. To generate an additional PDF documentation, you have to add the command-line option -pdf to the launch configuration. You can find the generated PDF file next to the EHANDBOOK Container file in folder specified for the generated results. The PDF contains the same static contents as the EHANDBOOK Container. The ECU software documentation files generated with EHANDBOOK Container-Build can be customized to adhere to the coorporate identity of the documentation provider by applying the correspinding branding and styling as well as by providing a custom title page. To organize the configuration files in ASCET-DEVELOPER, it is recommended to create a folder / directory within the workspace, e.g. ehb_configs. The customization is achieved by passing additional configuration files to EHB-CB via the command-line interface. In order to apply a custom header and footer text and logo, you have to create a branding.properties file which has to be passed via the CLI option -branding to EHB-CB. -branding ${workspace_loc}\\BoardComputer\\ehb_configs\\branding.properties The following example shows a branding.properties file for our example ETAS BoardComputer demo app. # Relative path to header image (.png) header.image=./css/ETAS_Logo_Blue.png # Legal text to be part of the topic footer and print-outs footer.text = Â© ETAS GmbH reserves all rights even in the event of industrial property rights. We reserve all rights of disposal such as copying and passing on to third parties. Note that this file must be saved with UTF-8 encoding. To provide a good first visual appearance and adhere to corporate design rules, you can provide a custom title page in the form of an SVG image. The SVG image must have the name title_page.svg and be located within the directory with the styling information for EHB-CB. You can apply custom contents to the title page image. For this, placeholders have to be embedded in the SVG image. These will be replaced with contents that are provided in a title_page.properties file. The latter must be located in the same directory as thje title_page.svg file itself. For details, see the Title Page Styling Guide that comes with the documentation of EHANDBOOK Container-Build. The custom title page image with additional textual contents from the title_page.properties is then shown in EHB-NAV directly after opening the corresponding EHB Container. In the same way, the title page image is shown on the first page of the generated PDF documentation. The visual appearance of both the HTML contents as well as the generated PDF from EHANDBOOK Container-Build can be customized via configuration files. The configuration files must be located in a styling directory (e.g., css) for which the path is passed to EHB-CB via the CLI option -css. -css ${workspace_loc}\\BoardComputer\\ehb_configs\\css As starting point, refer to the examples provided with EHANDBOOK Container-Build under \\examples\\styling","title":"Tutorial: EHB-CB for ASCET-DEVELOPER","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"contents","url":"/ehandbook/tutorials-cb/ascet-developer/contents.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":2},{"text":"Installation of tools & license keys","hash":"_installation_of_tools_license_keys","id":3},{"text":"ASCET-DEVELOPER","hash":"_ascet_developer","id":4},{"text":"EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools","hash":"_ehandbook_container_build_tools","id":5},{"text":"EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_ehandbook_navigator","id":6},{"text":"License keys","hash":"_license_keys","id":7},{"text":"Setting up the demo app in ASCET-DEVELOPER","hash":"_setting_up_the_demo_app_in_ascet_developer","id":8},{"text":"Creating a launch configuration for EHANDBOOK Container-Build","hash":"_creating_a_launch_configuration_for_ehandbook_container_build","id":9},{"text":"Running an EHANDBOOK Container-Build","hash":"_running_an_ehandbook_container_build","id":10},{"text":"Inspecting the EHANDBOOK Container in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_inspecting_the_ehandbook_container_in_ehandbook_navigator","id":11},{"text":"ASCET-DEVELOPER authoring styles","hash":"_ascet_developer_authoring_styles","id":12},{"text":"Snippet mode","hash":"_snippet_mode","id":13},{"text":"Expert authoring mode","hash":"_expert_authoring_mode","id":14},{"text":"Setting up the documentation infrastructure for the BoardComputer app","hash":"_setting_up_the_documentation_infrastructure_for_the_boardcomputer_app","id":15},{"text":"Attaching an ASCIIDoc documentation file to BoardComputer.bd","hash":"_attaching_an_asciidoc_documentation_file_to_boardcomputer_bd","id":16},{"text":"Writing documentation content in ASCIIDoc","hash":"_writing_documentation_content_in_asciidoc","id":17},{"text":"Headings","hash":"_headings","id":18},{"text":"Paragraphs","hash":"_paragraphs","id":19},{"text":"Images","hash":"_images","id":20},{"text":"Lists","hash":"_lists","id":21},{"text":"EHANDBOOK Function Overviews","hash":"_ehandbook_function_overviews","id":22},{"text":"EHANDBOOK Model Reference","hash":"_ehandbook_model_reference","id":23},{"text":"EHANDBOOK Plain Text Includes","hash":"_ehandbook_plain_text_includes","id":24},{"text":"Altering the launch configuration and generating an EHANDBOOK Container","hash":"_altering_the_launch_configuration_and_generating_an_ehandbook_container","id":25},{"text":"Inspecting the EHANDBOOK Container with textual documentation in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_inspecting_the_ehandbook_container_with_textual_documentation_in_ehandbook_navigator","id":26},{"text":"Attaching documentation to the BoardComputer app","hash":"_attaching_documentation_to_the_boardcomputer_app","id":27},{"text":"Generating an additional PDF documentation","hash":"_generating_an_additional_pdf_documentation","id":28},{"text":"Applying custom branding and styling","hash":"_applying_custom_branding_and_styling","id":29},{"text":"Header/Footer text and logo","hash":"_headerfooter_text_and_logo","id":30},{"text":"Custom title page","hash":"_custom_title_page","id":31},{"text":"Styling","hash":"_styling","id":32}]},"98":{"id":98,"text":"Welcome to EHANDBOOK! If you don’t know about EHANDBOOK yet, check out the overview at www.etas.com/ehandbook to get a background on what EHANDBOOK is, the problems it addresses and the benefits it provides. In this tutorial, we are going to build a small EHANDBOOK Container for an AUTOSAR (Classic) system using the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool-chain. For this, we will only utilize the AUTOSAR .arxml files relevant for the application software and the EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool-chain - nothing more. This tutorial requires EHANDBOOK 10.1 or higher. If you are interested in ASCET or Simulink models or C-Code, there are similar tutorials available as this one. Also, if you are more interested in ASAM-based XML formats for ECU software documentation, there is another EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool-chain available with a separate set of tutorials. So let’s get started! In order to install and execute EHANDBOOK tools, you need a PC (or laptop) with Microsoft Windows 10 or 11. You also need administrator rights to install the tools and license keys. For license keys, please contact your local ETAS sales office. For this tutorial, we’ll use the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools. You can download the latest version from the ETAS Download Center. To explore the generated EHB Container, you also need EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR installed. You can download the latest version from the ETAS Download Center. ETAS EHANDBOOK products are protected by electonic license keys. Please ensure that you have valid license keys to operate the tools. Please ensure that you have valid licenses for the AUTOSAR (Classic) add-ons for both EHANDBOOK Container-Build as well as EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. For trial purposes, you can obtain evaluation licenses for a limited time. To generate EHB Containers using the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools, the input data such as models, interface and label descriptions as well as textual documentation must be arranged in a directory structure. The directory structure must follow a specific convention: A root directory: This directory is passed to EHB-CB tool-chain as input directory One or more sub-directories: Each sub-directory represents a separate software component Within each sub-directory, files with model data as well as textual description is placed └── 📒 ECU_SW_XYZ ├── 📒 SWC_1 │ ├── 📄 swc_1_model.slx │ └── 📄 textual_description.adoc . . . └── 📒 SWC_2 ├── 📄 swc_n_model.slx └── 📄 textual_description.adoc For AUTOSAR (Classic)-based projects, the directory structure can be automatically generated with the help of EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools from the AUTOSAR .arxml files of the project. You can either use your own AUTOSAR .arxml files or download the example here. First, create a directory named FlexECU_AUTOSAR_files and copy the .arxml files into it. └── 📒 FlexECU_AUTOSAR_files ├── 📄 Actuators_Comp.arxml ├── 📄 Compositions.arxml ├── 📄 FlexECUDemoActuatorSoftwareComponents.arxml ├── 📄 FlexECUDemoApplicationSoftware.arxml ├── 📄 FlexECUDemoSensorSoftwareComponents.arxml ├── 📄 Interfaces.arxml ├── 📄 ParameterInterfaces.arxml ├── 📄 PlatformTypes.arxml └── 📄 Sensors_Comp.arxml Then, create a further directory named FlexECU_Dir_AUTOSAR. This will be the directory where EHANDBOOK Container-Build will create the directory structure for all the software components in the .arxml files. To generate the directory structure, run the following command: C:\\ETAS\\EHANDBOOK-Container-Build_10.1.0-Windows\\eHandbookCB.exe ^ -i \"FlexECU_AUTOSAR_files\" ^ -n \"FlexECU_Dir_AUTOSAR\" ^ -o \"FlexECU_Dir_AUTOSAR\" ^ -ar2ehbcbinput (1) 1 The command-line option -ar2ehbcbinput is used to initialize and generate EHANDBOOK folder structure from AUTOSAR files. The result should look like this: └── 📒 FlexECU_Dir_AUTOSAR (1) ├── 📒 CPT_Afr (2) │ └── 📄 CPT_Afr.adoc (3) ├── 📒 CPT_Ais (2) │ └── 📄 CPT_Ais.adoc (3) . . . ├── 📒 CPT_Wgc (2) │ └── 📄 CPT_Wgc.adoc (3) . ├── 📄 Actuators_Comp.arxml (4) ├── 📄 Compositions.arxml ├── 📄 FlexECUDemoActuatorSoftwareComponents.arxml ├── 📄 FlexECUDemoApplicationSoftware.arxml ├── 📄 FlexECUDemoSensorSoftwareComponents.arxml ├── 📄 Interfaces.arxml ├── 📄 ParameterInterfaces.arxml ├── 📄 PlatformTypes.arxml ├── 📄 Sensors_Comp.arxml . ├── ar2ehcbinput.log (5) └── 📄 tocs.yaml (6) 1 Output directory as specificied with -o command line option 2 Directory created for a software component prototype from the .arxml files 3 Textual documentation template in AsciiDoc format generated for the software component 4 AUTOSAR .arxml files (copied from input folder) 5 Log file created by EHANDBOOK Container-Build 6 The .yaml file which can be used to explicitly specify the table of contents For each software component, a separate sub-directory was generated. Within the sub-directory, an auto-generated AsciiDoc file got created. = CPT_Afr (1) == Component Overview (2) ehbfunctionoverview::CPT_Afr[Component Overview for CPT_Afr] (3) 1 Heading for documentation chapter for the software component 2 Heading for sub-section 3 EHANDBOOK AsciiDoc macro for generating a component overview diagram picture The EHANDBOOK container generated out of this directory structure will have two table of contents: Alphabetic order view: This is a flat list of all Atomic software components in alphabetic order. Composition view: This is a hierarchical structure which contains the Compositions along with the respective Atomic software components. The tocs.yaml file that is generated can be edited to explicitly specify the table of contents. For more information, refer to: Syntax of tocs.yaml. The contents of the generated directory structure can be further customized: Delete folders of software components that shall not be documented Add the corresponding ASCET or Simulink model file to obtain an specification for the internal behavior of the software component. Add the corresponding C-Code sources to obtain an interactive model for the implementation of the internal behhavior of the software component Alter the textual contents of the generated AsciiDoc files To generate the EHANDBOOK, run the following command: C:\\ETAS\\EHANDBOOK-Container-Build_10.1.0-Windows\\eHandbookCB.exe ^ -i \"FlexECU_Dir_AUTOSAR\" ^ (1) -o \".\" ^ (2) -n \"FlexECU_Dir_AUTOSAR\" ^ (3) 1 Input directory for generating the EHANDBOOK Container 2 Output directory 3 Name of generated EHANDBOOK Container file When you open the EHB Container in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR, the table of contents shown in the Document Explorer contains an entry for each software component. You can use the filter to quickly find a software component of interest. Each software component comes with a textual documentation as derived from the minimal AsciiDoc file. It comprises an auto-generated component overview diagram with requiring and providing ports as well as an auto-generated table with ports and their interface elements. You can create overview diagrams for multiple software components, showing the dependencies amongst the application software. To display more details, invoke \"Show Interface Elements\" from the global toolbar or the context menu. When you connect the overview diagram to an INCA experiment, this can be used for adding variables and parameters from ports with Sender/Receiver or Parameter interfaces directly to the experiment. The visualization of live values can provide you with more insights on the behavior of your AUTOSAR (Classic) based application software. Congratulations! You have successfully completed the tutorial! Here are few things you can do now: Add ASCET or Simulink models as specifications for the internal behavior for the software components. Alter the textual documentation by adding some auto-generated model screenshots using EHANDBOOK’s AsciiDoc extensions. Generate a PDF documentation for the contents of your EHANDBOOK Container. Check the command-line option -pdf. Apply custom styling and branding to your EHANDBOOK Container.","title":"Tutorial: Generate EHB Containers from AUTOSAR (Classic) .arxml files only","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"contents","url":"/ehandbook/tutorials-cb/autosar-classic-arxml-only/contents.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":2},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":3},{"text":"Installation of EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools","hash":"_installation_of_ehandbook_container_build_tools","id":4},{"text":"Installation of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_installation_of_ehandbook_navigator","id":5},{"text":"License keys","hash":"_license_keys","id":6},{"text":"Setting up the input data","hash":"arxml-to-EHB-CB-input","id":7},{"text":"Generate directory structure for EHB-CB from AUTOSAR .arxml files","hash":"_generate_directory_structure_for_ehb_cb_from_autosar_arxml_files","id":8},{"text":"Generate EHANDBOOK Container","hash":"_generate_ehandbook_container","id":9},{"text":"Exploring the EHB Container in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_exploring_the_ehb_container_in_ehandbook_navigator","id":10},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":11}]},"99":{"id":99,"text":"Welcome to EHANDBOOK! If you don’t know about EHANDBOOK yet, check out the overview at www.etas.com/ehandbook to get a background on what EHANDBOOK is, the problems it addresses and the benefits it provides. In this tutorial, we are going to build a small EHANDBOOK Container for a single ECU function modeled with ASCET 6 using the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool-chain. If you are interested in ASCET-DEVELOPER, Simulink models or C-Code, there are similar tutorials available as this one. Also, if you are more interested in ASAM-based XML formats for ECU software documentation, there is another EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool-chain available with a separate set of tutorials.

To generate EHB Containers using the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools, the input data such as models, interface and label descriptions as well as textual documentation must be arranged in a directory structure. The directory structure must follow a specific convention: A root directory: This directory is passed to EHB-CB tool-chain as input directory One or more sub-directories: Each sub-directory represents a separate function Within each sub-directory, files with model data, interface and label description as well as textual description is placed └── ECU_SW_XYZ ├── Function1 │ ├── function_1_model.axl │ ├── interface_and_labels.xlsx │ └── textual_description.adoc . . . └── Function_n ├── function_n_model.axl ├── interface_and_labels.xlsx └── textual_description.adoc Create a new directory EHB_ASCET6_Example_V1 to hold the input data for the EHB Container. Within that directory, create a sub-directory Function 1 to hold the sources of the ECU function we want to document. The sub-directory resembles a so-called documentation unit, i.e. an entity which contains all information required to document an ECU function. We’ll start with a small ASCET 6 model. You can either create your own ASCET 6 model or download the ASCET 6 model depicted below here. Place the ASCET 6 model file in the directory holding the input data the ECU function Function 1. Your directory structure should look like this: └── EHB_ASCET6_Example_V1 └── Function 1 └── function_model.axl We’ll use the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool in GUI (Graphical User Interface) mode to generate the first EHANDBOOK Container for our example. In the installation directory, double-click on the eHandbookCB.exe to launch the tool in GUI mode. Alternatively, invoke eHandbookCB.exe from the command line, but without any arguments. Specify the directory \\EHB_ASCET6_Example_V1 with the input data as input directory. Then, chose a directory where you want the generated EHB Container to be placed. A good convetion is to create a directory named outputs or EHB Containers next to the directory with the inputs. Specify EHB_ASCET6_Example_V1 as the name for the to be generated EHB Container. Press Generate container to start the generation. After the generation is completed, you can either open the output directory or directly open the EHB Container. You can download the corresponding EHB Container here. Let’s open the EHB Container and inspect the example. The EHANDBOOK Container contains exactly one ECU function - Function 1. When selecting the function in the table of contents, the chapter is empty because we have not added any textual description yet. We’ll do that later. When expanding the contents of Function 1, you can see one sub-entry with a special icon: The entry links to the ASCET 6-based interactive model. Click on the sub-entry to open the ASCET 6-based interactive model. The model is opened in a new tab. The ASCET 6-based interactive model directly resembles the original ASCET 6 model, hence the root-level is shown. Click on the + button to expand the contents. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR now unfolds the contents of the subsystem and embeds them in the context. Note that there are some gaps between the input and output ports and the input and output blocks of the subsystem. Click on the + button of the class instance block AddSrvClassInstannce to expand its contents. Click on the Auto-Layout button in the toolbar or select Auto Layout from the context menu. The contents of the diagram is now layouted using an automatic layout algorithm. This also allows drawing additional connections to obtain a seamless signal flow depiction across subsystems. Also, the diagram is now more compact. When switching to the Model Explorer, you can inspect the hierarchies of the complete ECU function as a tree view. Our first example is already functional, but not yet complete. It lacks two more pieces of information: a textual description to describe what the ECU function does an interface and label specification to denote how the ECU function connects to other ECU functions Let’s add them in the next sections. In our example, the function reads two variables - a and b from global memory and writes the output to a global variable result. The global variables denote the interface of the ECU function. To document this appropriately, EHANDBOOK offers the possibility to express this information as structured tables for variables and parameters. Furthermore, a graphical visualization can be derived by means of a function overview. To document information about the labels used by the ECU function as well as the interface specification in the EHB Container, this has to be described in the form of an Excel file which is stored in the same directory as the ASCET 6 model sources. The Excel file template comes with two sheets: one for signals and one for calibrations. Signals are global variables which can be measured with the help of measurement tools such as ETAS INCA. Signals which are read and written by an ECU function are used to exchange data with other ECU functions. Calibrations are variables for which the values can be changed / fine-tuned with the help of calibration tools such as ETAS INCA. Calibrations can be e.g. single scalar values take the form of curves or maps which are interpreted by 1D or 2D interpolation routines. For our example, create an Excel file with the following two sheets and store it in the directory where the ASCET 6 model file is located. Alternatively, you can also download the filled in Excel file here. To generate the EHANDBOOK Container using the EHB-CB tool, follow the same steps as described earlier. Launch the EHB-CB tool in GUI mode Specify the directory with the input data as input location Specify a directory as the output location Start the generation You can also download the corresponding EHB Container here. When you open the EHB Container in EHB-NAV, the first difference you will notice to the first example is that there is some textual content in the documentation for Function 1. For signals and calibrations, EHANDBOOK Container-Build automatically generates an additional sub-section and lists the details for these labels as structured tables. When you double-click on the entry Function Overview, a new tab is opened which shows the external interface of the ECU function as a model view. You can now start to expand the function overview block. This will expose the details of the Simulink based interactive model. Notice that the input and output signals used by the system function_model are connected to the so-called label ports of the function overview. Through this, the ECU function can be connected to other ECU functions, establishing a seamless signal flow diagram. The first example now also conains the interface as well as label specification for the ECU function. The interactive models are now fully complete. In the next section, we’ll add a textual description for the ECU function. Textual descriptions are typically used to explain the purpose of the ECU function to the reader. To add a textual description, you have to place a document in AsciiDoc format (.adoc) in the directory of the ECU function. You can write a new document from scratch using a text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and save it as .adoc file. EHANDBOOK supports basic features of AsciiDoc such as document structure in the form of chapters and sub-sections. You can write paragraphs, include raster images (e.g., JPEG format) and add tables. Alternatively, you can also download an example AsciiDoc document here. In order to document ECU functions, it is often helpful to have a model screenshot followed by some textual explanation. EHANDBOOK Container-Build can automatically generate a screenshots from Simulink based interactive models that can be embedded in the textual documentation. To generate a screenshot, you have to create a model reference to the Simulink model and the subsystem you want to depict. This can be achieved with the EHANDBOOK model reference directive: ehbmodelref::[] For example, to obtain a model screenshot for the block diagram of the Subsystem subsystem in the Simulink model file function_model ehbmodelref::\"Project/Main/Module/Main\"[Project/Main/Module/Main] To generate the EHANDBOOK Container using the EHB-CB tool, follow the same steps as described earlier. Launch the EHB-CB tool in GUI mode Specify the directory with the input data as input location Specify a directory as the output location Start the generation You can also download the corresponding EHB Container here. When you open the EHB Container in EHB-NAV, the chapter now also contains a chapter Function_1 with sub-section Function Description. In the section Function Description, we had given a brief textual explanation of what the ECU function does. Furthermore, we had given a reference to the subsystem Subsystem. EHANDBOOK Container-Build has generated a model screenshot and integrated this a the place of the model reference. Furthermore, the model screenshot is linked to the interactive model. By clicking on the button Open interactive model, the block diagram for the subsystem is opened in a new model viewer tab where it can be further explored. Congratulations! The example EHB Container is now complete. The EHB Container includes a textual documentation with automatically generated model screenshot. Furthermore, the labels of the ECU function are documented by means of structured tables. For the interface, an automatic generated function overview is available. The latter is directly linked to the interactive model which has been generated from the Simulink model. Here are few things you can do now: Create more EHB Containers with different models. You can load and combine them in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Create a single EHANDBOOK Container with multiple functions. For this, create sibling directories next to the directory for your one ECU function, add your input data and run EHB-CB. Generate a PDF documentation for the contents of your EHANDBOOK Container. Check the command-line option -pdf. Apply custom styling and branding to your EHANDBOOK Container.","title":"Tutorial: Directory-based EHB-CB for ASCET 6","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"contents","url":"/ehandbook/tutorials-cb/dir-ascet-6/contents.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":2},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":3},{"text":"Installation of EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools","hash":"_installation_of_ehandbook_container_build_tools","id":4},{"text":"Installation of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_installation_of_ehandbook_navigator","id":5},{"text":"License keys","hash":"_license_keys","id":6},{"text":"Setting up the input data","hash":"_setting_up_the_input_data","id":7},{"text":"Directory structure for the input data","hash":"_directory_structure_for_the_input_data","id":8},{"text":"ASCET 6 model","hash":"_ascet_6_model","id":9},{"text":"Generating the first EHB Container","hash":"_generating_the_first_ehb_container","id":10},{"text":"Exploring the EHB Container in EHB-NAV","hash":"_exploring_the_ehb_container_in_ehb_nav","id":11},{"text":"Summary and next steps","hash":"_summary_and_next_steps","id":12},{"text":"Adding label information and interface specifciation","hash":"_adding_label_information_and_interface_specifciation","id":13},{"text":"Input data for label information and interface specification","hash":"_input_data_for_label_information_and_interface_specification","id":14},{"text":"Generating the EHANDBOOK Container","hash":"_generating_the_ehandbook_container","id":15},{"text":"Exploring the EHANDBOOK Container in EHB-NAV","hash":"_exploring_the_ehandbook_container_in_ehb_nav","id":16},{"text":"Summary and next steps","hash":"_summary_and_next_steps_2","id":17},{"text":"Adding a textual documentation","hash":"_adding_a_textual_documentation","id":18},{"text":"Textual documentation as AsciiDoc file","hash":"_textual_documentation_as_asciidoc_file","id":19},{"text":"Referencing to model screenshots","hash":"_referencing_to_model_screenshots","id":20},{"text":"Generating the EHANDBOOK Container","hash":"_generating_the_ehandbook_container_2","id":21},{"text":"Exploring the EHANDBOOK Container in EHB-NAV","hash":"_exploring_the_ehandbook_container_in_ehb_nav_2","id":22},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":23}]},"100":{"id":100,"text":"Welcome to EHANDBOOK!

If you are interested in ASCET 6, ASCET-DEVELOPER or Simulink models, there are similar tutorials available as this one. Also, if you are more interested in ASAM-based XML formats for ECU software documentation, there is another EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool-chain available with a separate set of tutorials. So let’s get started! In order to install and execute EHANDBOOK tools, you need a PC (or laptop) with Microsoft Windows 10 or 11. You also need administrator rights to install the tools and license keys. For license keys, please contact your local ETAS sales office. For this tutorial, we’ll use the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools. You can download the latest version from the ETAS Download Center. To explore the generated EHB Container, you also need EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR installed. You can download the latest version from the ETAS Download Center. ETAS EHANDBOOK products are protected by electonic license keys. Please ensure that you have valid license keys to operate the tools. For trial purposes, you can obtain evaluation licenses for a limited time. To generate EHB Containers using the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools, the input data such as models, interface and label descriptions as well as textual documentation must be arranged in a directory structure. The directory structure must follow a specific convention: A root directory: This directory is passed to EHB-CB tool-chain as input directory One or more sub-directories: Each sub-directory represents a separate function Within each sub-directory, files with model data, interface and label description as well as textual description is placed └── ECU_SW_XYZ ├── Function1 │ ├── function_1_implementation.c │ ├── interface_and_labels.xlsx │ └── textual_description.adoc . . . └── Function_n ├── function_n_implementation.c ├── interface_and_labels.xlsx └── textual_description.adoc Create a new directory EHB_CCode_Example_V1 to hold the input data for the EHB Container. Within that directory, create a sub-directory Function 1 to hold the sources of the ECU function we want to document. The sub-directory resembles a so-called documentation unit, i.e. an entity which contains all information required to document an ECU function. We’ll start with a small function implemented in C code. You can either create your own C code or download the C code depicted below here. int a; int b; int result; void calc() { result = a+b; } Place the C code file in the directory holding the input data the ECU function Function 1. Your directory structure should look like this: └── EHB_CCode_Example_V1 └── Function 1 └── function_implementation.c If the implementation is split across mutliple C-code files, all .c/.h files that cab be associated with the function should be provided in the directory of the function. In case of commonly used code, the latter can be provided as a library path (see C-code configuration). The C-code does not have to be complete. If source code for called functions is not available, the latter do not get resolved and are represented as black boxes. Pre-processor macros must be resolvable. I.e., if macros are defined, they must be resolvable. This is required for the code to be unambiguous. We’ll use the Directory-based EHANDBOOK Container-Build tool in GUI (Graphical User Interface) mode to generate the first EHANDBOOK Container for our example. In the installation directory, double-click on the eHandbookCB.exe to launch the tool in GUI mode. Alternatively, invoke eHandbookCB.exe from the command line, but without any arguments. Specify the directory \\EHB_CCode_Example_V1 with the input data as input directory. Then, chose a directory where you want the generated EHB Container to be placed. A good convetion is to create a directory named outputs or EHB Containers next to the directory with the inputs. Specify EHB_CCode_Example_V1 as the name for the to be generated EHB Container. Press Generate container to start the generation. After the generation is completed, you can either open the output directory or directly open the EHB Container. You can download the corresponding EHB Container here. Let’s open the EHB Container and inspect the example. The EHANDBOOK Container contains exactly one ECU function - Function 1. When selecting the function in the table of contents, the chapter is empty because we have not added any textual description yet. We’ll do that later. When expanding the contents of Function 1, you can see one sub-entry with a special icon: The entry links to the C-code-based interactive model. Click on the sub-entry to open the C-code-based interactive model. The model is opened in a new tab. The C-code-based interactive model directly resembles the program structure of the C-code sources. As root-level, the set of top-level functions is shown - in this case, only one - calc. Click on the + button to expand the contents. EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR now unfolds the contents of the function calc and embeds them in the context. The data and control flows of the algorithms contained in the C-code sources are visualized as block diagram. The diagram itself is layouted using an automatic layout algorithm. When switching to the Model Explorer, you can inspect the hierarchies of the complete ECU function as a tree view. Our first example is already functional, but not yet complete. It lacks two more pieces of information: a textual description to describe what the ECU function does an interface and label specification to denote how the ECU function connects to other ECU functions Let’s add them in the next sections. In our example, the function reads two variables - a and b from global memory and writes the output to a global variable result. The global variables denote the interface of the ECU function. To document this appropriately, EHANDBOOK offers the possibility to express this information as structured tables for variables and parameters. Furthermore, a graphical visualization can be derived by means of a function overview. To document information about the labels used by the ECU function as well as the interface specification in the EHB Container, this has to be described in the form of an Excel file which is stored in the same directory as the C-code sources. The Excel file template comes with two sheets: one for signals and one for calibrations. Signals are global variables which can be measured with the help of measurement tools such as ETAS INCA. Signals which are read and written by an ECU function are used to exchange data with other ECU functions. Calibrations are variables for which the values can be changed / fine-tuned with the help of calibration tools such as ETAS INCA. Calibrations can be e.g. single scalar values take the form of curves or maps which are interpreted by 1D or 2D interpolation routines. For our example, create an Excel file with the following two sheets and store it in the directory where the C-code files are located. Alternatively, you can also download the filled in Excel file here. To generate the EHANDBOOK Container using the EHB-CB tool, follow the same steps as described earlier. Launch the EHB-CB tool in GUI mode Specify the directory with the input data as input location Specify a directory as the output location Start the generation You can also download the corresponding EHB Container here. When you open the EHB Container in EHB-NAV, the first difference you will notice to the first example is that there is some textual content in the documentation for Function 1. For signals and calibrations, EHANDBOOK Container-Build automatically generates an additional sub-section and lists the details for these labels as structured tables. When you double-click on the entry Function Overview, a new tab is opened which shows the external interface of the ECU function as a model view. You can now start to expand the function overview block. This will expose the details of the C-Code based interactive model. Notice that the input and output signals used by the system function_model are connected to the so-called label ports of the function overview. Through this, the ECU function can be connected to other ECU functions, establishing a seamless signal flow diagram. The first example now also conains the interface as well as label specification for the ECU function. The interactive models are now fully complete. In the next section, we’ll add a textual description for the ECU function. Textual descriptions are typically used to explain the purpose of the ECU function to the reader. To add a textual description, you have to place a document in AsciiDoc format (.adoc) in the directory of the ECU function. You can write a new document from scratch using a text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and save it as .adoc file. EHANDBOOK supports basic features of AsciiDoc such as document structure in the form of chapters and sub-sections. You can write paragraphs, include raster images (e.g., JPEG format) and add tables. Alternatively, you can also download an example AsciiDoc document here. In order to document ECU functions, it is often helpful to have a model screenshot followed by some textual explanation. EHANDBOOK Container-Build can automatically generate a screenshots for block diagram visualizations derived from C-Code that can be embedded in the textual documentation. To generate a screenshot, you have to create a model reference to the C-function you want to depict. This can be achieved with the EHANDBOOK model reference directive: ehbmodelref::[] For example, to obtain a model screenshot for the block diagram of the calc function in the C-code source of Function_1 ehbmodelref::\"Function_1/Function_1/calc\"[Function_1/Function_1/calc] To generate the EHANDBOOK Container using the EHB-CB tool, follow the same steps as described earlier. Launch the EHB-CB tool in GUI mode Specify the directory with the input data as input location Specify a directory as the output location Start the generation You can also download the corresponding EHB Container here. When you open the EHB Container in EHB-NAV, the chapter now also contains a chapter Function_1 with sub-section Function Description. In the section Function Description, we had given a brief textual explanation of what the ECU function does. Furthermore, we had given a reference to the subsystem Subsystem. EHANDBOOK Container-Build has generated a model screenshot and integrated this a the place of the model reference. Furthermore, the model screenshot is linked to the interactive model. By clicking on the button Open interactive model, the block diagram for the subsystem is opened in a new model viewer tab where it can be further explored. Congratulations! The example EHB Container is now complete. The EHB Container includes a textual documentation with automatically generated model screenshot. Furthermore, the labels of the ECU function are documented by means of structured tables. For the interface, an automatic generated function overview is available. The latter is directly linked to the interactive model which has been generated from the Simulink model. Here are few things you can do now: Create more EHB Containers with different models. You can load and combine them in EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Create a single EHANDBOOK Container with multiple functions. For this, create sibling directories next to the directory for your one ECU function, add your input data and run EHB-CB. Generate a PDF documentation for the contents of your EHANDBOOK Container. Check the command-line option -pdf. Apply custom styling and branding to your EHANDBOOK Container.","title":"Tutorial: Directory-based EHB-CB for C-Code","component":"ehandbook","version":"12.1","name":"contents","url":"/ehandbook/tutorials-cb/dir-ccode/contents.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":2},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":3},{"text":"Installation of EHANDBOOK Container-Build tools","hash":"_installation_of_ehandbook_container_build_tools","id":4},{"text":"Installation of EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR","hash":"_installation_of_ehandbook_navigator","id":5},{"text":"License keys","hash":"_license_keys","id":6},{"text":"Setting up the input data","hash":"_setting_up_the_input_data","id":7},{"text":"Directory structure for the input data","hash":"_directory_structure_for_the_input_data","id":8},{"text":"C code","hash":"_c_code","id":9},{"text":"Generating the first EHB Container","hash":"_generating_the_first_ehb_container","id":10},{"text":"Exploring the EHB Container in EHB-NAV","hash":"_exploring_the_ehb_container_in_ehb_nav","id":11},{"text":"Summary and next steps","hash":"_summary_and_next_steps","id":12},{"text":"Adding label information and interface specifciation","hash":"_adding_label_information_and_interface_specifciation","id":13},{"text":"Input data for label information and interface specification","hash":"_input_data_for_label_information_and_interface_specification","id":14},{"text":"Generating the EHANDBOOK Container","hash":"_generating_the_ehandbook_container","id":15},{"text":"Exploring the EHANDBOOK Container in EHB-NAV","hash":"_exploring_the_ehandbook_container_in_ehb_nav","id":16},{"text":"Summary and next steps","hash":"_summary_and_next_steps_2","id":17},{"text":"Adding a textual documentation","hash":"_adding_a_textual_documentation","id":18},{"text":"Textual documentation as AsciiDoc file","hash":"_textual_documentation_as_asciidoc_file","id":19},{"text":"Referencing to model screenshots","hash":"_referencing_to_model_screenshots","id":20},{"text":"Generating the EHANDBOOK Container","hash":"_generating_the_ehandbook_container_2","id":21},{"text":"Exploring the EHANDBOOK Container in EHB-NAV","hash":"_exploring_the_ehandbook_container_in_ehb_nav_2","id":22},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":23}]},"101":{"id":101,"text":"Welcome to EHANDBOOK!
